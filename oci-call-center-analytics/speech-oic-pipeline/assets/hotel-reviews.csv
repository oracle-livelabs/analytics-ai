575499706,2018-04-24,"This XT property definitely meets my expectations for a full service hotel as facility is well maintained and the employees are extremely courteous and attentive.  The room was pleasant and for me was a two room suite.  The master bed had its own door for privacy and the bathroom is accessible by both rooms via a single door.  There was plenty of room to relax with a hide-away sofa and the desk was well lit for work.  A simple service bar is available with complimentary coffee/tea and a wine refrigerator.  The view I had was shared by the Executive lounge which overlooks the Crystal Mall.  If you're into sushi, there are two incredible places just across the street, as well as an Earl's and other fine dining.  It was close to where I needed to be so it was not only comfortable but convenient as well.  I have already returned to this property and hope to stay again when I return for more business.",Vancouver
477003835,2017-04-18,"One night in Vancouver when we visited our son who goes to college there. I ravel a lot and stay in many hotels. The service at The Vancouver XT Metrotown was courteous and efficient. The 11th floor room was nicely appointed, spotlessly clean, and smelled fresh. The elevators actually go nice and quickly, which is a bonus on the 11th floor. Bed was comfy. Everyone was so friendly. Even the cleaning staff were full of smiles and wishing us a good morning.This makes a big difference! But best of all was the restaurant. We just had one meal there (dinner). The food was excellent (my wife has chicken and I had fish). The service was spectacular - our server was deligtfuland really on the ball (I forget her name, but she was from the Czech Republic Republic). She really looked after us. Overall an excellent stay and I highly recommend this hotel. It's a people business and these folk get it!",Vancouver
488584133,2017-05-28,"My vehicle was parked in underground hotel parkade during my 3 day stay there.  My vehicle was broken into shortly after I checked-in. The hotel asked if I was in valet parking - I was right beside it.  But no security cameras caught the break-in.  There was no electronic gate at the entrance or exit.  Very bad security!  I lost approximately $800 in valuables including prescription medication.  I asked if the hotel would pay the deductible for the broken window and locks.  I was told the XT did not own the parkade and that there were signs advising that it was not responsible for vehicle break-ins.  Other than that, I found the staff quite friendly and the accomodation quite nice.  The $30 I paid for my daughter's breakfast buffet was a little steep!",Vancouver
242843543,2014-12-03,"Vancouver was a significant stop on a 5 week road trip from Jackson, Wyoming, ending in Northern California.  To reduce expenses, I booked this hotel using XT points.  Although the hotel is not in downtown Vancouver, it was an easy train ride into town.  Our room was upgraded, and we had a separate bedroom and living area.  As a result, my friend had to sleep on a sleeper sofa which wasn't the most comfortable.  The extra space was helpful, but her sleeping arrangements weren't ideal.  The hotel staff is friendly and provided good directions to the train station and local transportation.  When driving it, it took us quite some time to find the hotel even with GPS, and traffic was horrific.",Vancouver
288729010,2015-07-13,"The best cost benefit for a family of four with an excellent location in Vancouver: public transportation, variety of good restaurants and a shoping mall at one block, plus an outstanding service from all employees of the hotel. My wife, two teen kids and I, comfortable in the same suite, it is possible at this unique XT. Despite some minor issues like: no microwave in the room, no breakfast family package, no shuttle to anywhere, which i would firmly suggest to XT of considering these easy improvements to gain the excellent, as the experience for staying for a long period is, so far, totally acceptable without suffering.",Vancouver
296762201,2015-08-07,We stayed 6 nights at this hotel a little bit further than Vancouver. It is a five minute walk away from the Metropolis Metrotown shopping mall and across the street from a supermarket and drugstore. The neighborhood is under construction but once inside the hotel you enjoy a quiet atmosphere and luxurious large rooms. Prefer to stay at a high level for enjoying the view to the buildings and mountains. We definitely recommand this hotel if you have a car to drive to Granville Island or Vancouver. Selfparking is available  for a fee but you can choose valet parking alternatively. We enjoyed free wifi.,Vancouver
168480110,2013-07-21,"Being a XT Diamond member for many years, to say I have many points of reference is redundant. This is one of those XT's which is a standout. the location is great; adjacent to Metrotown and SkyTrain. The executive lounge staff is top-notch and include Jennifer and Candace. The two ladies and very polite, professional, friendly and efficient. I could have easily stayed closer to my work, but found this XT my preference even if I had to take a taxi to and from work every day. I believe I stayed here at least 8 different weeks over a couple of years and will whenever I do visit again.",Vancouver
627361020,2018-10-22,It was a first visit to Vancouver for a 3 day event held at this hotel. Every employee we encountered was intent on making sure our stay was comfortable and stress free.  The food was delicious both in the restaurant and at our event.  Our beds were comfortable and made up fresh every day. Especially appreciated were the manager and chef that came running to help with a nasty glue gun burn during prep for the event. That chef even checked on me during lunch the next day.  This hotel made an unforgettable event even better. Let's hope the Hearties use them again next year. â¤ï¸,Vancouver
422826413,2016-09-27,We stayed three days pre cruise on route to Alaska and one day post cruise on return. The hotel is well positioned for the sky train for exploring down town with the usual comforts you expect from the XT brand. We were travelling with our two friends who like ourselves noted the friendly helpful manner of the staff. Sometimes in a big organisation this can be the hardest area to get right. But as we say in Scotland everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet and the staff from the doormen breakfast and bar staff to the reception were exceptional. Great chat and good fun.,Vancouver
558030698,2018-02-02,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had picked it due to its location near the skytrain. However despite being a XT Honors member and using 30,000 points we were given a different room to what we booked and it overlooked a noisy very large construction area. Very disappointing after a 14 hr plane trip! It was also near a very noisy ice machine - staff made no effort to discuss while we were there and to reconcile. Despite this beds were comfortable and food in restaurant in hotel was very good. The hotel lacks atmosphere though - needs a makeover. ",Vancouver
188227404,2013-12-21,"This was our first trip ti Vancouver (and Canada). This hotel is about a 20 minute train trip from the city center and water front but the train station is just a street or two away from the hotel, there is also a bus station nearby if you fancy a bus trip into town! There is a supermarket, a huge shopping center and lot of restaurants very close by too. To me, it seemed to be a area dominated by Asian shops and foods, which was wonderful! The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was great and kept spotless while we were there.",Vancouver
603130672,2018-08-05,"Excellent location, within walking distance from the Metro station, Metropolis mall, Pricesmart grocery store and Halal food whih is located right behind the hotel.The Filipino lady at the front desk (apologies I forgot her name) was very professional and kind. Mr.Raju at the conceirge was knowlegable and professional and helped us plan our activities.Ronaldo Santos the Bell man was helpful and extremely kind to my kids.The hotel room I stayed in was at the 14th floor, it was clean and nice. I would definitely stay there again.",Vancouver
632946445,2018-11-12,"The entire staff was excellent and went beyond expectations. My companion became ill and they went out of their way to make her feel better. The manager went as far as going out to get pain medication for her and having a microwave brought to our room. With service like this, we will continue to come back each year. The location has access to a great balance of city vibe and neighborhood feel. There is so much you can walk to if you are interested in taking scenic excursions. I have no complaints whatsoever.",Vancouver
493689401,2017-06-17,"It's 3.15am in the morning, I have two young babies and no CRIBS are available it's pure and utter torture we have had no sleep even though I called ahead before and requested them. Just told to sleep with them in bed which is impossible and unsafe with two of them. This is a night from hell. This is disgraceful and totally unfair. Hotel of bloody torture this is. Will never ever be staying here again. If you have children don't stay here your more than likely won't get a crib! Beware!!!",Vancouver
427724843,2016-10-13,"Vancouver has a lot of hotels - The XT Metrotown is a great hotel for business travelers.   It's a full service hotel and it has all of the amenities and services that you need.   Personally, I like it because of its location - I can easily drive to job sites - and if I want to go downtown, Translink station is close by.This is not the newest property but it's well maintained and nice and clean.   Staff are very friendly and helpful and speak multiple languages.",Vancouver
357298156,2016-03-21,"We stayed here for just one weekend.  We never did use the internet, gym or pool. As we were too busy with friends and family.  But the view was nice, staff were great, room was very clean.  My husband and I would definitely stay there again. The location perfect; we could walk to shopping or restaurants, and use the sky train to get downtown. We do not like to drive much in Vancouver, so we left our car in the underground parking- which was extra, but worth it.",Vancouver
207977422,2014-05-29,"The rooms are spacious, immaculate and the bed is luxurious.  The hotel was very quiet and the restaurant has an extensive buffet.   Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Burnaby.  Below the hotel is the delightful Crystal Mall which is an Asian Shopping Mall and across the street is a beautiful park.  Within a short block is the Metro Mall which is fantastic and offers all high brand name stores.  The location of this hotel cannot be matched!!",Vancouver
542125603,2017-11-19,This is the second year we have stayed at this hotel because of an event we attend. It is kind of an expensive hotel with expensive parking charges. We have never eaten in the hotel as there are a lot of less expensive alternatives for meals close by. If we did not get a group rate we would probably look for a less expensive alternative.  One thing to note - the beds seem kind of hard. By the third of the 6 nights we were there it was getting uncomfortable.,Vancouver
210704268,2014-06-17,"why stay downtown when you can beat congestion by staying here? easy to reach all downtown activities n Richmond. located next to a mall with great Asian cuisine food court. disappointed in the small pool n spa size, though n the fact that its difficult to reach (definitely Not handicap accessible!).  but room was large, beds comfortable, view wonderful. parking is an extra $11.00/night charge, though.  really??? Why? breakfast buffet was great, but pricey.",Vancouver
460176110,2017-02-15,"We would like to commend your staff Eddie. We booked 4 rooms next to each other on the 8th floor as we were all from out of town and went to Vancouver to attend a friend's funeral. On our last night, feb11,  we ordered soda to be brought to our room. When he learned we were having a get together to celebrate memories of our friend's life, he brought us plates, forks, chips and nuts! We were surprised and deeply touched with the gesture. Thank you Eddie!",Vancouver
274211719,2015-05-24,"No need to pay exorbitant Vancouver downtown prices. This hotel worked out well for us. We got the King suite and was perfect for 2 adults and 2 kids. Hotel and rooms were very clean, staff friendly and helpful. Metrotown Skytrain station just 5 min walk away so very easy and reasonably priced to get to and from Vancouver downtown. Chinese food court of the adjacent Crystal Mall accessible from the 2nd floor with great Chinese and Malaysian options.",Vancouver
640437177,2018-12-18,"I have stayed in this XT many times and it never disappoints, it is likely my favorite XT property.  There are a number of good restaurants within walking distance, although the food and service at the in house restaurant and bar normally keep me here.  If you want to head downtown the sky train is only a block away, it's about a 20 min ride.  For exercise, Central Park is a quick walk and offers a great trail and 5k path for a jog.",Vancouver
528619112,2017-09-30,"This hotel is not in downtown, but it is very close to the sky train, that takes you to downtown in about half hour. It is also close to the Metrotown bus stand, where I got off when I came from Victoria by the ferry and then by bus. The metrotown mall is at the bus stand, 2 mins walking distance from the hotel, so there are lots of eating options here as well in the mallâ€™s food court. In that way, XT Metrotown is very well connected.",Vancouver
176000655,2013-09-05,"I've been travelling to the Metrotown XT for over 4 years, monthly, for business purposes and have had consistent, professional, kind and caring service from each and every staff, every visit. They know their jobs, always go the extra mile, are friendly, kind and sincere. They truly enjoy making every guests' stay comfortable and worry free. I know this because of how I am treated and how I see them treat other guests. Like family!",Vancouver
397457911,2016-07-25,"This hotel has everything you need plus the nicest staff.  My key stopped working in the elevator and, the second time resetting it, the gentleman at the check-in counter came out to the elevator to try it himself.  He made sure I didn't have any problems.  As a woman often travelling alone, I felt very safe and comfortable.  Windows don't let a hint of outdoor sound in - totally quiet even with all the construction in the area.",Vancouver
497789391,2017-07-01,"Stayed here using XT Honors points. The hotel is about 20 minutes outside of downtown Vancouver next to the enormous Metropolis Mall. The sky train is one block away and it will zip you into downtown. The hotel is comfortable, the room was clean and the service was really friendly and accommodating. The food is pricey, but in line for Vancouver (the 3rd most expensive city in the world). Had a nice five night stay.",Vancouver
333416739,2015-12-16,"I travel 40 weeks out of the year and have been a loyal XT guest for many, many years. Of all the XT brand hotels, this is my favorite. It has been two years or so since my last visit and it is still great. The staff, especially Jennifer in the Opal lounge are superb. Walking distance to Metrotown and Skytrain are added bonuses. Thank you for making my business trip relaxing and comfortable once again.",Vancouver
609668219,2018-08-23,"Room was a King bed  delux on the 9th floor. Separate bedroom from living area. Clean, comfortable bed. Spent 3 nights on business - desk was well organized for laptop and plugs for charging to do work. Room was cleaned daily - friendly staff. Just sorry I missed the bbq on the rooftop thursday evenings. Hotel was a 5 minute walk to Metrotown tower I and II and the sky train. Definitely recommend",Vancouver
169110677,2013-07-25,"The staff were always welcoming, helpful and happy.  The hotel is perfectly situated for shopping, getting downtown by SkyTrain and having a suite for less than paying downtown prices.  The hidden secret is that it is attached to Crystal Mall that has amazing and authentic Asian food for a very affordable price.  With a kids and adult pool, it made it very nice for everyone to get what they wanted.",Vancouver
393351174,2016-07-16,"Prices were very high, for a &quot;days inn motel&quot; experience. Quite basic, somewhere to sleep essentially. The pool is  a &quot;lap pool&quot;; enough for two people and the hot tub that was &quot;warm&quot; probably fit around 3 people. Not even a complimentary breakfast, $21.00 for the buffet, how tragic. However very good location, close to mall, skytrain, and food. Would not come back.",Vancouver
632366990,2018-11-10,"We found this hotel perfect for a weekend getaway. It's close to Metrotown shopping center and to the Crystal Mall. Crystal mall for those that dont know is Asian focused; it's a great for food,farmers market, and herbal medicines. So many restaurants to dine  near by the hotel. Valet parking reasonable. The hotel bar/lounge and dining were clean, comfortable and relaxing. We'll be back.",Vancouver
428828920,2016-10-17,"The hotel is located in a great area, especially if you are using public transit. Not the best for visitors with a vehicle, especially large SUV/Trucks. Parking is difficult at best. The hotel has been around now for 10+ years and starting to look a bit dated, the interior needs refreshing. Lot's of amenities nearby with in walking distance since the shopping mall is next door.",Vancouver
590955849,2018-06-26,Really a super location to avoid the downtown Vancouver madness while still maintaining proximity. Right on the SkyTrain line with the metrotown station only a block from the hotel makes it super easy to go downtown. Hotel is clean and modern. Pool is small but it has a hot tub as well. A decent small gym which has a massive well appointed good life fitness across the street.,Vancouver
234877435,2014-10-17,This hotel is centrally located to the downtown area and the airport with great views of the Mountains.  The staff was all very nice and my room was very clean.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again the next time I am in Vancouver.,Vancouver
517856154,2017-08-26,"Excellent hotel great service, friendly, helpful staff throughout the hotel including Reflect Lounge. We stay here once every six months for three days.

579049860,2018-05-09,"I always stay with XT so it was a no brainer for me to book at this hotel. Service was excellent! I had a gorgeous view of the North Shore Mountains from my 12th floor room my room itself was nowhere near worth what I paid for it. The furniture was old, worn out and frayed. Everything except the linens, mattress and TVs very much need replacing and/or updating.",Vancouver
208635401,2014-06-02,"the room is clean and big enough. Considering it is XT the price is also attractive. However I think it should be equipped with free parking and free internet which is not. Maybe it is my fault not to check the parking police in advance(I think it will be free parking as all the other hotels I stay in Canada), so I was surprise to pay for the parking fee.",Vancouver
638393123,2018-12-09,"Had rate issues with hotel. Hotel would not honor reserved rates. Diamond desk was very uncooperative. It will be a pleaseure to stay somewhere elese.

498666431,2017-07-04,"There aren't too many XT properties in Vancouver, considering its size, but I chose this one because of its location to downtown, price and the reviews that I saw on it.

I got an upgrade to a suite which was in good condition and I liked the decor - light and airy.  The executive lounge was the best out of the one's I stayed at on this work run though it still doesn't even come close to comparing to the XT in Bangkok.  They have a nice balcony area with a single lane lap pool which was great for a cool morning swim as it was heated.  The gym is pretty dark and small.  Is it the best XT, no.  Is it the worst, far from it though the price seems steep (though all hotels in Canada seem expensive for what they are).",Vancouver

It's the same story with the breakfast buffet and the pool, almost made it but just missed. They charge gold members for hot breakfast and the pool is a joke, I don't even know why they built it. Parking is $16 a day in a somewhat confusing garage. On the plus side the lounge is a nice place to relax, have a drink and watch the game. Will probably stay again because the number of XT properties within the area and affordability is limited.",Vancouver

After gathering the luggage cart and my luggage in front of the bellman, he followed me to the elevator and then asked if I needed assistance???  I arrived in my room to find the soiled bathroom. I called the front desk and informed them of the bathroom condition and requested to be relocated. I returned to the front desk and spoke with the manager who acknowledged the room's condition and offered me a choice of a room on the 16th or 18th floor.

You are in the suburbs for sure at this hotel.  So, if you want a decent place to meet for dinner you will need to take the 20 minute drive into downtown Vancouver.

It's close to a couple of parks including Central Park. Metrotown Mall and the train station is about a 5 to 7 min. walk.  There are some restaurants in the area that are walking distance.  The hotel is right next to Crystal Mall and there's an Asian food court that's connected to the lobby via the 2nd floor.  The train ride to downtown Vancouver is about 20 min.

It's in the suburb of Burnaby, around 20 to 30 minutes from downtown depending on traffic and where you're going.Overall we liked the property. We had a car (parking is $11 Cdn self-park or $15 valet), but it isn't far from the SkyTrain that will take you to downtown Vancouver. The hotel is at Metrotown, a large mall and entertainment center, if you're into shopping. You should know, however, that there construction going on directly across from the hotel.

482192279,2017-05-06,This property is not new. It is at least 20 years old I would guesstimate. The layout and floorplan are clearly dated though there has been some effort made to maintain the property and ensure that the furnishings carpets etc. were in good condition.  The service was very average. The staff were superficially friendly and I had no major issues during my stay. The property could desperately do with some updating however the location around it makes up for some of this.

Breakfast on the third floor, workout on the second, or lumber along two blocks to the Metrotown stop.  A bit sterile, the entranceway doesnâ€™t portend well the rooms homey comfort and design.  I do wish they gave fruit and or coffee/ tea choices for guests near the concierge.  A great bonus is the building is built next to a great market with everything soups to nuts, and prepared foods.  Hang out.  People watch.  Learn to make a dumpling... worthy of the people of Vancouver.  ",Vancouver

Generally the staff was timely except when i tried to do quick check-out over the phone and  gave up after several minutes when no on came on the line.  I did like getting a room number in advance.

Ideal location for the train station to downtown Vancouver, 20 min ride, and also for the Metropolis Mall (400 shops and food stalls). Hotel room was quiet but pick the higher number rooms and the highest number you can get on the floor as the ice machine is close to the lower numbered rooms and is quite noisy.  The staff were keen to meet the needs of everyone, booking taxis, lending umbrellas, pointing out places to go, accommodating food requirements. Shusheel Prem was the perfect host and managed the arrival of about 50 guests, for an unexpected breakfast, with politeness and efficiency.  Only downside is the access to complimentary wifi which was very limited and would not support more than two mins without logging off. However, this was a minor point as we were on holiday.  A great stay.",Vancouver

281024091,2015-06-17,Just finished two great nights here. We were looking for a place to stay for the World Cup. The XT was reasonably priced and had king size suites that accommodated our family. The rooms were nice clean and spacious. Easy access to the Skytrain and two blocks from one of the largest malls that I have ever seen. I travel 2-3 times a month and I will say this hotel had the nicest most accommodating staff that I have ever experienced. When we arrived we needed a roll-a-way bed and once the gentleman from housekeeping brought it and saw our large family he went back and got us extra towels and toiletries without us even asking. The host/restaurant manager and the servers were spectacular as well as the front desk and bell service. There was a consistency from everyone that you rarely see these days. A job well done!

Predominantly urban downtown view from our 12th floor full wall window with a teaser view of Mt. Baker in the distance on clear days.

I phoned the front desk to ask what the wifi password was - I was informed that wifi was an extra $8.00 per night.

The hotel is in Burnaby but is just a short drive (or train ride) to Vancouver and is much cheaper than the hotels downtown. My room was comfortable and spacious. Wireless internet was free with good strength and service. The pool and hot tub were nice ways to relax at the end of the day. Parking was $12/night and was underground. The only issue is that it is connected to the mall parking and the traffic can be a bit hectic. Room service was okay but quite expensive for what you get. As well, the selection is limited especially if you are staying for a long period of time (I was here for a week). The restaurant and lounge are okay but again expensive with small portion sizes.

I did find the room quite small and was able to see hallway light by my bed which was a bit distracting.What I did find irritating was the parking situation.  There is a cost for parking. but the irritation comes with driving into the parking lot as it is shared with a mall.  It's very congested and you need to ensure you are on your A game in order to not scrape a wall.  I will stay there again, but will likely take a cab.Also, a few of my coworkers were charged for internet and parking, even though, under our corporate rate it was to be removed off their bill.

It is also quite a distance from the airport so not that accessible for travellers.  The area has mostly oriental restaurants and shops in the mall in the lbottom of the Hotel.

Located in the business district of Vancouver it is very handy to the SKYLINE, and incredibly cheap and convenient way to get around Vancouver, you don't need a taxi within the zones, a bit like London - just buy a day pass.     The rooms are fairly large and the bed was big and very comfy. We had a fridge and good size bathroom in the room as well as a good size TV (but a bedroom is for one of two things, one is sleeping).

Most of the staff is very courtesy, particularly those at the front desk. The rooms are large and many offer a beautiful view of skyscrapers and mountains. The breakfast buffet is perfectly acceptable but the latency shown by the breakfast waiter both mornings we dined was frustrating. Slow to bring us drinks and VERY slow to pick up our used/finished plates from the table. He needs to really get on the ball and be more responsive to the hotel's customers. If it wasn't for the less than stellar service offered at the restaurant I probably would have rated the property very good instead of average.",Vancouver

Exit a side door and you are in Crystal Mall, an Asian mall with a food court.  Finally, the price is much more reasonable than a stay in downtown Vancouver,The Executive Lounge serves two hot items (steamed dumplings and spinach pies one night), plus a cheese tray and desserts.  There is also an honor bar with a delicious hard cider.  This time the hotel was overrun by high school students on a school trip.

Tip - you can cut through the strip mall where Best Buy is to get to Metrotown rather than walking around.The outdoor pool and hot tub were closed due to it being winter. The gym is small but adequate with various cardio machines and some free weights. Tip - take earphones to plug into the separate media screens on each machine.

There is a fee but it is reduced for XT honours members. The concierge and front desk staff are great. We have stayed at the holiday inn express which is closer to the mall and has breakfast but I much prefer the XT. The rooms are bigger and better designed. The windows are large with great city views. The beds are way comfier and most importantly there is silence in the room. I recommend paying more to stay here. There is also a great Asian mall just off the lobby. It is like a mini Chinatown with an Asian market and many stores. Also, we ordered pizza from room service.

I had a killer view of downtown Vancouver from the 17th floor, amazing!  Room was comfortable and clean, and housekeeping did a great job.  The executive lounge was superb, great views, great spread of appetizers and nice breakfast variety.  Service in the lounge was second to none.  As far as location, this was a double edge sword.  The hotel is right next to two malls, one of which is full of Chinese markets and restaurants.  Several other good restaurants were also an easy walk away.  However, this hotel is a good distance from the center of downtown.  It is only about $3 to get downtown on the light rail, but it will take about 30 - 40 minutes total with the walk to the station and the ride.  Worth weighing the trade off.  Overall a great stay and I would recommend highly.",Vancouver

I was staying on a mix of points and paid stay nights which has proven complicated at other hotels.  Not here.  I didn't have to do a thing. So kudos to a well trained staff.  Parking is free which is a rarity.  As I am XT Gold I was given the continental breakfast buffet which is upgradeable to anything off the menu or the hot breakfast buffet for only $4.00.  There are lots of restaurants within walking distance and downtown Vancouver is a quick Sky Train ride away.,Vancouver

The upgraded one bedroom suite and the complimentary concierge lounge are second to none.  Jennifer who worked the lounge most evenings when I was there does a superb job.  She is very personable and friendly.  All of the hosts do a great job.  My only request would be a bit of variety in the morning hot dishes.  I stayed 10 days and it was always scrambled eggs and potatoes.From the first impression at the front desk to the entire day to day hotel experience this is a very customer focused hotel.,Vancouver

I had 3 rooms booked under my name, because they were sold out, the hotel randomly decided to cancel two of the rooms which I booked for my clients.  They refused to provide any additional rooms and we all had to share.  Even after speaking to the XT Diamond desk who said they were at fault, and tried to reason with the hotel manager.  Nothing was done. It was horrible, especially if you consider I am a XT Diamond member. The hotel itself if okay, it's a basic XT that hasn't been updated for awhile.

Just be careful if you are looking for a great location - it was a bit of a walk to the train (especially with bags) and personally I found it to be a bit out of the way. There were some good places to eat - all within a 15/20 minute walk but not a lot of alternatives directly beside the hotel. Depends what you are looking for really!",Vancouver

The room lacked a fridge and microwave which was kind of inconvenient. The room itself was nice. I loved the floor to ceiling windows. The bathroom however looked like it was missed during the cleaning. There was hair under the sink (not just a strand that could have come from the Housekeeper her/himself) and hair hanging from the fixtures in the shower. It was pretty gross and led us to doubt the cleanliness of the rest of the room.The staff was wonderful. Very helpful, friendly, and informative.The location of this hotel is pretty good.

Later I found that sign was beside the elevator I got off from. The sign should be on the opposit site! Room was clean with a contemporary design. The bed was somewhat uncomfortable and my body was aking in the morning. My real peeve was the washroom. It's very small.

Here, however, the experience was not so nice; despite having received an upgrade, the room was quite ordinary, and the executive lounge decisively small. The biggest problem, however, was the location: despite being presented as a Vancouver XT it took me about 50 minutes to reach downtown (Burrard Street), and this was what pushed me eventually to switch to a more central hotel.

They all bent over backwards to help us in every way from check in to helping us get around. So the negatives about the property are a small executive lounge used for the complimentary breakfast for diamond members. It is WAY undersized. The hotel could really be improved by remodeling this area.  Another change that should be made is to improve the access to the pool area. One has to traipse through the exercise room and then ascend a set of stairs. Otherwise the hotel is well kept, located close to the SkyTrain and the Metrotown mall (though the access is a bit hampered currently due to the construction nearby).  ",Vancouver

Multiple restaurants are within walking distance and the hotel restaurant was outstanding for both breakfast and dinner.

Two small drawbacks made this a 4 and not 5 star review: the bathroom in our suite was cramped (yet the bedroom on the other side of the wall had large extra empty space), and it was tricky to get your key into the elevator slot to select your floor.

I wrote a not so good review last time around, but I'm glad to say that management had fixed most items that I was complaining about, and we had a very pleasant stay this time. Staff was quite responsive to our needs. We checked in very late and found that our room has a very bad smell of cigarette smoke, given that no rooms of the same configuration was available, we were offered a smaller room with extra bed for the night, and would be changed back the next day. I was expecting we won't get the new room until check in time the next day, and was surprised to get a phone call that the room is ready at 10am the next morning.

I stayed in the Executive Floor Suite but the room was huge, except the decor was quite out of touch with time.   It reminded me of my university apartment instead of a real executive floor suite in the millennium age.   However, I did enjoyed their executive floor lounge (though a bit small) and the hot food and beverages there.  Their staff was very courteous and helpful.   The Metrotown XT had a huge shopping mall in its vicinity and it had a nice food court and miles of retail shops.   However, I found the $360 per room to be a bit high for what I was paying.  It sure was not luxurious like the XTs in Asia. ",Vancouver

We were upgraded to a suite, which had a larger sitting room, sofas, etc.  The pull-out couch was not so good to sleep on, but they never are. Exec. lounge access was nice, and the spread was also pretty good.  Alcohol is not free, and having to put your card into the door to enter makes it one of the least inviting lounges I've been to.

You can always be nice to your guests and dont have to act like i commited a crime! Breakfast selection was very poor! However, the room that i got was clean. No bottle water was provided. Basically it was good for sleeping and there is a nearby train station that brings you to the city. A shopping mall and a few eateries are within walking distance. I'd suggest marriot which is next door is wayyyy better!",Vancouver

The downside is the safety and security. My best friend parked their car at the basement of the hotel and she lost her bag. The door was forced open and the burglar stole her whole bag. She was so bummed about it and the husband was also feeling inconvenienced because the car door was left damaged because of the forced entry.

Just a pet peeve of mine, but kids under 16 shouldn't be allowed in executive lounges.  It makes it anything but relaxing and quiet.Given the high cost of land values in SW British Columbia, it's unreasonable to complain the rooms are on the tiny side (which they are).

We were on the Exec Club floor and had access to the lounge on the 18th floor and had an excellent evening snack which was ideal when we were so tired.  We had some excellent recommendations for dinner which were well made.  We may just have been tired but we all thought the beds and pillows the best we had every expereinced.Location for a toursit is not excellent but the hotel is close to the SkyTrain and about 15 minutes from downtown.

We had breakfast in the restaurant and the buffet was well stocked and the food was excellent.  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant one evening and the food and service were very good.  My only knock on the hotel is its location.  While the train is only a couple of blocks away, it still takes at least 30 minutes to get downtown.

We did not use the pool.There is a large mall within easy walking distance and several restaurants plus of course the large food court at the mall. The wifi was very good.",Vancouver
368758507,2016-04-29,"We decided to stay at this hotel because it was close to where we were going to compete in a floral design competition.  To our surprise it was also convenient to the sky train so we had no trouble getting to the sights we wanted to visit.  The hotel is a little in need of a face lift in the lobby but our room was terrific and had all the things we needed.  I always appreciate having a safe, makeup mirror and a bath mat.  The room was well equipped and clean.  We stayed on the executive level and loved the breakfast and evening appetizers. We plan to stay again in September.  Great hotel for the money!",Vancouver
418538781,2016-09-14,This was our second stay in three months.  We appreciate the location of the hotel as it is close to the meeting venue and convenient to the Skytrain.  We had use of the Opal Lounge which is terrific.  The breakfast is as good as it gets and the evening spread is ample.  The room was clean and the hotel staff is extremely helpful and pleasant.,Vancouver
427088616,2016-10-11,"I used to stay at the XT - close to Metrotown, sporting events etc... so we gave it a shot.  The staff were helpful and kind.  The desk staff, valet and housekeeping were fantastic.  The room was spotlessly clean (thanks Isabelle) but the shared spaces were well below what we expected.  For instance the grimy passage you walk up to get to the pool was dirty enough I wouldn't walk it barefoot.  the pool itself was fun for the kids swim team.  The lap pool (2m x 10m) is nice but it does a stairway (with metal pole) coming down on one end (one child swam right into it!)The unexpect high was seeing the crystal mall's food court.  Fantastic bubble team!Parking was near capacity at all times - and during rush hour it took me almost 10min to exit the parkade.  Plan ahead.",Vancouver
581144280,2018-05-18,A tall building which was a great landmark if yoi ever got lost.Found some of the staff a bit lazy whilst others were really helpful.Big airy rooms just a short walk away from all the hubbub and pulsating nightlife.Comfortable room in a pleasant and safe area there is even an off licence ( liquor store) semi adjacent to the hotel.Approx 10 mins to sea port by cab so a nice location all round.,Vancouver

597182719,2018-07-17,"I was there for a conference at Simon Fraser University, which was about 20 minutes away up Burnaby Mountain.  The hotel is central in Burnaby, steps away from LOTS of shopping.  There are many restaurants and transit is a short walk.  There is a liquor store, restaurants and other useful places nearby.  The hotel, while a little bit dated in spots, was in great shape.  The water pressure was great, the cooling was quiet and worked well.  My room was very large - a suite.  Others were not as large.  The hotel has a restaurant/bar and ample indoor parking (at a price).  the room cleaning service was very good in that I was running a weird schedule and they seemed to work around it.   Would stay there again.",Vancouver
551215027,2018-01-03,Worst night ever first told us that we could check in early came at the 3pm for check in room wasn't ready  had to go sit in the bar and wait till they call you .waited till 5pm went back to the desk to ask if the room was ready they told me that it was ready half an hour ago but they didn't call us like they said they would.didnt get in till about 5pm dinner started at 6pm rooms suck had a suite wouldn't stay there very again go to the holiday inn across the road instead and the XT charges for parking also which is very cheap on there part not even downtown understand but Burnaby bc  really river rock suite was much better,Vancouver
593116289,2018-07-04,"This is a really comfy place to stay. There is some construction going on, but that doesnâ€™t bother the hotel or your stay. The hotel is in close vicinity of the Skytrain to downtown. Enough restaurants in the direct surroundings and a nice shopping mall.Staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. For business guests there is a nice lounge available. Very quiet place.",Vancouver
602665977,2018-08-04,"We stayed at the hotel for over a week, on the whole a good choice as the location is very convenient.  Easy access to Metrotown Mall, short walk to the Skytrain station and bus station.  There are a few restaurants in walking distance, also Tim Hortons, Subway to grab a quick bite, grocery stores etc.  There is a lot of building work going on opposite the hotel but this didn't cause any disturbance. Hotel itself was clean but does need a bit of modernisation.  Gym was very cold (AC turned up very high and non adjustable) and early on a weekend can get quite full - limited machines.  Disappointed with lack of bottled water - staying for quite a few nights I would expect to be given water each day - not the case for this hotel.  Staff were friendly enough but could be better, and on our last day did have a run in with the bellboy.Overall a pleasant stay.",Vancouver
213566707,2014-07-03,"Great hotel. Unsure of the problems others had after reading other reviews, but my stay was fantastic - the staff were friendly, the rooms were spacious and clean and their is a variety of food options as well.  My parents stayed in another room to mine which I didn't find as nice as mine - I would recommend asking for a room that has a high floor, but also that faces the skytrain as the view is better. Both of these things should reduce the noise as well.  I wasn't overly impressed with the value of the evening meals, but they were good. Breakfast is a good shout as their are good options and it's served from 6am-11am.  The Metrotown shopping centre is a 5 minute walk away where you can shop for groceries as well as find fast food restaurants as alternative food options.  I would re-book without hesitation next time I'm in Vancouver.",Vancouver
426055278,2016-10-08,"This hotel is what you would expect from a XT. Clean, good sized rooms etc. The only problem is the distance to downtown, the train journey is long-winded and the airport by train is very inconvenient. Also, very disappointing we were unable to leave our luggage at the branch downtown on the day we checked out of the Burnaby branch. We just wanted to leave our luggage to save us having to get the train all the way back before heading back in the same direction to the hotel. With such a large chain and the cost of a stay relatively expensive, I thought this would have been something they would have been able to do to show good customer service. ",Vancouver

A credit to the XT chain.Hotel is opposite the biggest mall in BC and very handy to visit other parts of BC and beyond.",Vancouver
350984797,2016-02-25,"While conveniently located and clean, I was disappointed with the service and food at this hotel. The lounge food was mediocre, I found mold on my toast and did not get apologies when I complained. The bill for the room was shoved halfway underneath my door (not in a sealed envelope) and so my personal details were exposed to anyone who passed by. Again no apologies when I complained.",Vancouver

Infrastructure, oh really.",Vancouver
352025887,2016-02-29,Pay attention to the location of this hotekl. If you're purpose of visit is leisure this is probably not the ideal hotel for you.

198329315,2014-03-22,"I stayed at the XT Metrotown for a couple of nights.  Everyone was good - although there's nothing to write home about.  Room is fairly decent.  Service is typical XT quality too.  The hotel is indeed connected to the food court of a shopping center, making food choices plentiful.  There's also a shopping mall within walking distance too.",Vancouver
161834654,2013-05-25,First I want to say if you are only staying for a few nights or not eating at the hotel the rooms are great. They are little suites and the housekeeping staff is excellent even though I did not use them everyday. As a diamond member the lounge is a great extra at night but the restaurant in the morning was not very good. I had vouchers being a diamond member so I went downstairs so I could use the gym a little later. The eggs benedict was cold. That was all I tried to eat on that side of the buffet. They then charged me for the hot buffet which I did not eat because it was cold. Not great service to notice that and after I said something. Otherwise good hotel. Parking is not fantastic but its traveling.,Vancouver
286916038,2015-07-08,"The service and staff have an amazing attitude at this hotel especially the valet and the breakfast staff. We stayed here for four nights and we loved it. It's conveniently located close to the train, mall, central park and central to many areas such as granville (25 minutes) the victoria ferry (45 minutes) and grouse mountain (25 minutes). It's clean and nice all around. We got upgraded to a view room double queen but there was some construction accross the street so the beeping noise on the excavators was on early around 7 a.m. It wasn't too bad but would have been nice if it wasn't there. Highly recommended.",Vancouver
217845245,2014-07-27,"We stayed 4 nights here.  Clean and quiet hotel. The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk to the skytrain.  Lots of parking underground, though it's fills up in the evening. The front desk was quite helpful. For XT diamond members, there's free food in the morning and evening. The staff were all helpful and friendly.  There's quite a bit of traffic in the surrounding area of the hotel.",Vancouver
274851930,2015-05-26,"We were looking for a less expensive option in the Vancouver area and didn't mind the drive from Burnaby.  Less than 30 minutes drive to almost everywhere we wanted to go. Got a great deal on the XT.com website. Front desk team was smiling, professional, and cheerful.  I received an upgrade due to my status and the room was great. Great housekeeping. Hotel is well maintained throughout. Self parking is ample, even if the parking lot is a bit of a tight squeeze. Convenient to both Metrotown mall and SkyTrain. Very good stay and excellent value for the money.",Vancouver
234432839,2014-10-14,"This was the only XT property that was near my meeting. My hotel room was spacious and well decorated complete with fridge. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with directions and temporary valet. However, self-parking was challenging (it was difficult to find a space as the parking structure is shared with the mall so specific parking spots have to be used) and expensive considering I self-parked. It was also a little difficult to find given the one way streets.   The wifi didn't seem to work very well with my computer or my phone.",Vancouver
442768391,2016-12-07,"The location was a good trade off from staying in downtown comparing rates. The Asian food court next door and the number of other restaurants all in walking distance is also a plus, although not for those looking for typical mall restaurants. The concierge lounge had more actual food than just appetizers and the service was good. I booked the one bedroom suite and it was worth it for the extra space. The metro stop is just across the adjacent shopping center, very convenient. ",Vancouver
425338560,2016-10-05,"Stayed at this hotel for business on two separate occasions. Rooms are great and the staff is always pleasant. If you stay on the executive floors, you have access to complimentary continental breakfast which was great as it saved me time in the mornings before heading out to work.

502308993,2017-07-15,The room was pricey for the quality. There was mold in the shower. The couches were very worn and torn. $300 a night - not worth it. For being a XT - I am surprised with the mold in the shower. Shocked. ,Vancouver
616261359,2018-09-13,"I stayed for four days during a small vacation to Vancouver. Upon arriving at the lobby I was greeted by the person at the counter, who was all smiles and looked happy to help me check in. The process was rather quickly and I was quickly given a room key. I had room service the first night and the food was great, and the desserts were amazing. The food is definitely made to order and fresh. The rooms were standard and did look a bit dated considering Ive been at other XT hotels, but the rooms were very clean and functioning. ",Vancouver

When in the area, for sure I'll return here!",Vancouver

Many many choices and I was asked if I wanted eggs Benedict or omelet as well.  I am a sucker for the bennie.  My server was right on the ball with the coffee top up.  Ask for Robert.Do yourself a favour and forget about Expedia and book the bed and breakfast directly.",Vancouver
600927929,2018-07-29,"My husband and I had a 1 night stay at the XT Metrotown and we would highly recommend this hotel.  Staff were extremely helpful and friendly, at the front door, at the reception desk, and in the restaurant.  Our corner suite had a beautiful view of the mountains, as well as being spacious and spotlessly clean.  The room was also very quiet and we had a great sleep, which is unusual in a hotel.  We would definitely go back! ",Vancouver

173730144,2013-08-23,"We tried to book a room at the XT Garden Inn in downtown Vancouver, but it was sold out. That hotel recommended this one as an alternative. This hotel was a high-rise in the town of Burnaby. Parking was $9/day for guests. Burnaby is an ethnic neighborhood with a large shopping mall and great Asian restaurants. The sky-train was approximately 3-4 blocks away. The trip to downtown Vancouver took about 20 minutes. Trains were frequent.The hotel and our room was clean. Breakfast in the hotel was expensive, so my husband walked one block to the grocery store and brought back fruit/muffins. We also grabbed sandwiches for the road at the Subway, also one block away.Wi-fi was only free in the lobby, so my kids spent some time down there.If you insist on staying at a XT property and can't stay in downtown Vancouver, this is a reasonable alternative.",Vancouver

The XT was only a couple of blocks from the skytrain which took about 15 - 20 min. to downtown so it was great.  There is a huge mall across the street if you like mall shopping.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  We arrived early (about 10:00AM) and they couldn't get us into the room we had requested but did offer another room which is great considering check-in isn't til 3:00.

A good size for a family with one child. Large TV, good quality boxspring beds all fine. The public areas are average. The pool and fitness center got a big minus and is more like &quot;we have also something&quot; however nothing to spend some quality time. All together the hotel is good for a one night stay. Not really a XT quality and everything a bit older.",Vancouver
389945659,2016-07-06,We were very disappointed that the price of the room did not include internet access or parking. Almost every hotel these days offers free wifi a big name like the XT should too. The location wasn't very central and considering everywhere in Vancouver has picturesque mountain the view out a window was very of concrete buildings. On the plus side the rooms were very clean and the front desk staff were very friendly! ,Vancouver

Very quick and easy access to the SkyTrain, which gets you to downtown Vancouver in 20 minutes.  There is an Asian Mall , Crystal Mall, attached to the hotel, with very strange hours for a large mall, 10;00a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  The much larger Metrotown Mall is about a block down the street.

The feel of being in the middle of the city.   My only complaint was the parking.  They have a parking garage attached to the hotel however about 98% of it is reserved for valet, leaving only about 20 spots for self park.  Hotel clearly is trying to push guest to valet only at a higher cost.  This might not have been so bad but it took forever for someone in valet to come take the car and return it back to us.  If they are going to basically only give you a valet option, then someone needs to light a fire under those valet employees to start providing better service.",Vancouver

This was not much of a problem because the Skytrain works very well and it is only two blocks away from the hotel. The hotel is also only two blocks away from the Metrotown Mall , which turned out to be a fun place to shop.Finally, I looked around at prices in hotels near Canada Place and properties of similar qualities were significantly more expensive and many were not available.

Fails on appearance and comfort, is dated and showing it. This area has nothing besides a mall so donâ€™t look for good spots to eat, you wonâ€™t find them. The area is not safe and leaves little room for personal safety.Amenities in the room are hit and miss, my hair dryer melted, no iron and my scenery was a roof. I was moved in the end but wonâ€™t be going back",Vancouver

I agree with the recommendations of others of staying on the executive floor is where it is at.  Great view and free breakfast.  You have Price mart to get all your groceries a block away and the metro town mall where you can shop to your hearts content with three different levels.  The metro town hotel was great and the customer service was excellent especially a staff member named Leonora who helped us with reservations.  You will have to pay for parking but you can take the sky train everywhere which is also a block away. ,Vancouver

Internet is not free, no complimentary water for XT gold card members, shower was rinning poorly, no international TV channels, fitness centre just offer 2 threadmills and a few mattresses + weights. Area is ok, close to shopping district and seminar place is ok. Summarized the hotel is ok, but it is much far away from outperforming. I did expect a little bit more for that price.",Vancouver
402280378,2016-08-06,The location of this hotel is excellent.  Access to the SkyTrain to get downtown makes this property an alternative to staying in the city.

The staff are friendly, and I really appreciate the location and the room sizes.  The lounge is okay - decent cocktails, but the food selections there and in the restaurant are a little pricey for the quality.  Luckily, there are many great options nearby.I don't love having to swipe my key or phone to get the elevators to work - the added security is nice, but it seems unnecessary given the neighborhood and front desk staff.  The bedside clock is also super bright - I generally just unplug the thing, since my phone is my primary alarm anyway.A highlight is always the front desk staff.  Maybe it's how they're managed, or maybe it's their team make up, but they are a great, friendly group who always seem genuinely glad to see me back.",Vancouver

A love seat or large armed chair would go a long way.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the housekeeping was quite good.  The restaurant is weak ... we dined there twice.  The restaurant staff is good, but the food is just okay.  Parking is combined with the adjacent mall and is plentiful.

The hotel is attached to an Asian strip market. Metrotown very close just a short walk. Nice clean rooms, no complimentary breakfast unless you are a diamond member or staying on the top two floors. Then you can eat in the Opal Lounge for breakfast and evening appetizers. Probably shouldn't say this but our room key malfunctioned and gave us access to the Opal Lounge even though we were staying on the fifth floor lol. So we enjoyed some free food we just had to act like we were rich and we had no issues so if you're staying here, try and see if your room card will open the lounge door on the 18th floor.

390876002,2016-07-09,"I'm unfamiliar with Vancouver, and thought this location was a little too far from the city's attractions to warrant such a high price.  But it was close to mass transit, so we were able to get downtown with a little advance planning.  We stayed on the executive level and had access to the lounge, which was really nice. The evening &quot;cocktail hours&quot; and breakfasts were wonderful.  The one complaint we had was addressed during our stay.  The previous guest(s) had clearly been smoking, and the room smelled of cigarettes. They offered to move us to a different room, but we wanted to stay on the executive level. So they sent up an ionizer to help remove the odor, and that worked well enough.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and genuinely wanted to make things right, and we really appreciated that.  I would highly recommend this hotel for someone looking for a nice place to stay in the Vancouver area.",Vancouver
552783271,2018-01-09,"I was hesitant to stay outside of Downtown Vancouver when I booked Metrotown. I have never been in this area before, but the reviews said it was conveniently located next to the largest mall so I said what the heck.  Over our 5 day stay, I didn't step foot in the mall. LOL! We didn't need to.  There is so many things around the hotel in walking distance. We did nightly 2-1/2 hour foot and body massages at Yuen Foot Spa. It's a few blocks down the street. Highly recommend. The Metro is right down the street so for $2.85CAD, you can take a quick trip to various spots in Downton Vancouver, like the Waterfront and Gastown. So easy, I was amazed! Parking at the hotel is really low too.  Only $16/night as compared to $30-$40/night in Downtown properties.  We already booked our stay for our next trip to Vancouver!!!",Vancouver

The service in the bar/restaurant was very nice.  The hotel is not located downtown on the waterfront like some of the others we considered, but that's probably why the price was much more reasonable.  It's attached to a small mall that is entirely full of Chinese stores and products, which we found fun and interesting.  It's only a few blocks from the skytrain, and there is a very large mall only a few blocks away as well.  The non-central location worked quite well for us, though it would have been nice to have had access to more good restaurants.  All in all, quite a good place.",Vancouver

Hotel is located close to shopping and the Sky Train.The Con's:  the on-site gym is very small and cramped, undersized for an 18-storey hotel.  The WiFi is virtually unusable.  I stayed on business, and attempting to get caught up on work using the hotel WiFi was pointless.  Email and web browsing is horribly slow.  Don't even bother trying to participate in a Webex or GoToMeeting session.  Want to FaceTime your family back home?  Use LTE instead.  I wound up leaving the hotel and using the free Wifi at Starbucks.  The Verdict:  If you are looking for a clean room with basic amenities, then the XT Metrotown is for you.  If you want luxuries like usable WiFi, you are better served by Hyatt or Sheraton.",Vancouver

It is also connected to Crystal Mall for excellent Asian food.  Don't pass up this cultural experience!   The breakfast buffet is excellent.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Fitness room is great.  Wifi works great except you need to sign in everyday but no big deal. If you have a car, this is a great XT hotel to stay at.",Vancouver

The hotel is clean, the rooms are adequately furnished and the hotel staff is always friendly and willing to lend a hand. The only hassle is finding parking underground after hours or during mid-day shopping since the hotel shares parking with the nearby mall. Otherwise, if your travels take you to Burnaby, be sure to check out XT Vancouver Metrotown!",Vancouver
209342785,2014-06-07,"We stayed on vacation. Great location just outside of the Vancouver city limits with quick access to all major roads. Was the perfect location for our sightseeing adventure. One recent review complained about $ for parking and internet; I've never stayed in a big city where those weren't charged for. The fees were reasonable considering what I've paid in eastern US cities. Morning views of the city and mountains were wonderful. If you have access to the top floor breakfast and happy hour, they are worth the charge (being a XT owner,it was included in my charges). The Crystal City Mall area was very interesting, lots of very good restaurants in the area. The metro sky-train is only a block a way. The staff was excellent in their treatment of all guests. I only had one complaint and it was dealt with swiftly. If I return to Vancouver, I will definitely stay here. Wife is getting used to staff getting our tough sounding last name right.",Vancouver

The Asian mall attached to the hotel was interesting, we tried to go eat there but nothing was in English.  Went to the Metropolis mall which is 5 minutes away walking.  The parking was underneath the building and it is shared with the Asian mall, very tight down there be careful.  Room and service were very good.  We ordered room service twice and it was good and the server was attentive.  Clean, large room.  Too bad in a few months you will only be able to see more buildings out of the window.

I would liked to have rated it as a 5 but as I didn't eat at the restaurant or use the gym facilities I felt I didn't have a complete picture.  I had a lovely room on the 16th Floor with beautiful views of Vancouver and the mountains.  The staff in the check-in were great as was the bell staff at the entrance to the hotel.  I had access to the Executive Lounge where they had a great choice of evening appetizers, drinks and deserts.  Plus in the morning it has a range of breakfast items. The lounge is not huge but seems to cope with the number of guests using it.  The staff member looking after the facility was really attentive to your needs.  It was great to relax there after the journey, enjoy a drink and take in the magnificent views.  My room was really quiet and I had a wonderful nights sleep in the very comfortable bed.

Small suite and the executive lounge is not as good as our previous experiences in other XT Hotels. Milk in the espresso machine was awful. Bad hot sweaty stench in the top floor that never really went away despite staff assurances. Questionable neighborhood. It has a third world feel to it.

My bridesmaid had to speak with the front desk to remind them to make sure the room was extra special for when we came back after the wedding. When my husband and I got back to the room the room was filthy. The housekeeper made the bed and sprinkled rose petals all over the floor and bed but failed to clean the rest of the room.

The maid service is wonderful, they kept my room tidy and clean and I never had to ask for anything. Very thoughtful and always little extras like chocolates on the pillow and the newspaper delivered to your door. Great specials like the 2 for 1 buffet and the option of upgrading to a suite for a very nominal fee. Very quiet and comforting to stay at this Hotel. Have never had a problem with noise and I am super fussy about having my peace and quiet. I travel a lot and have stayed in many resorts and Hotels and I have to say the XT is the only one where I have never had to complain about noise.

There are no signs telling you that 1-3 are full so you have to do the rounds and discover the joy of the car park.There is a pool on the third floor. When we were there, it was dominated by children with their parents refusing to supervise and there were nobody from the hotel to keep order. They were jumping in and out of all the pools despite signs saying no diving etc and screaming their heads off. This went on till well beyond 10pm.

Furthermore the internet access is not free, they charge you 8$ per day and you cannot connect more than 3 devices per room even though  they allow up to 4 people per room.

The view from our room was very nice, and the room itself was clean and trendy.  The restaurant was empty, but the food and service were very good.

The service was excellent (especially that provided by bellman Joseph) and the executive lounge was quite impressive for a &quot;lesser&quot; XT--pleasant staff and decent food options.  A big plus of the hotel is that it is adjacent to the Crystal Mall which offers abundant cheap and tasty Asian food options.

We stayed for 3 nights, and regardless of when we arrived, the hotel designated parking, which XT shares with other businesses, was full and we needed to spend extra time looking for a spot. Premium internet is slow (1MB/sec): for XXI century you would expect at least 10MB/sec or more, plus you would have to login every time you stop your session. Breakfast buffet is good. We custom ordered a few dishes and on average it took them 20-30 min to deliver, which is a lot for a simple omelet. The location is okay - safe and clean outside, except the large construction work in front of the entrance which would divert the foot traffic around the fence. The SkyTrain stop if 5 min walk, hence the convenience and noise from the passing trains.

When you are spending 180+ days a year on the road, small things like being greeted by name and just knowing that they will always try to take care of me makes all the difference in the world.  They are the reason why I keep coming back to XT Metrotown for 6+ years now (despite also being a SPG Platnium 100 and a new Westin Elements just opened next door!)

Although a bit old, The room was large, quiet (ours faced away from the construction project), clean, and very comfortable. The one thing lacking was a bathroom fan - steamy from the shower. The young woman at check in was very professional and helpful. Likewise, the bell captain was very good. In contrast, a couple of millennial males at the registration desk had a laugh and smirk at our expense as we came through the lobby one weekday evening back to our room.

The staff was friendly, room was clean - Water was $2 / bottle, internet was $8/night for shoddy connections.

While the Skytrain wasn't an issue, if we return to Vancouver, we'll likely stay in a more centrally-located hotel. Two bummers- just to get a cup of coffee in the morning, we had to walk a few blocks to the Starbucks at the Metrotown Mall. Not a huge deal, just would have been nice if there was a coffee shop in the lobby or closer by. Also, the hotel is connected to the Crystal Mall, an Asian shopping center.

There were not enough signs if you were going up to the 2nd floor by escalator or by elevator to help you to the workout facilities or pool.

I would recommend it to anyone visiting Vancouver or just passing through catching a cruise.",Vancouver
261567374,2015-03-24,"I had flown in after a 17 hour flight and boy, was I glad to check in to this hotel and my room. Modern simplicity at its best. The room and bathroom was clean and well-maintained, and pretty spacious. The bed came with loads of pillows and was super comfy, it was HEAVEN after my long flight. I've stayed in  hotels downtown which were expensive, on the cruddy side and really not worth the money. Here, you get a lovely experience and you're just minutes away from the Skytrain. It's also a really quiet and safe neighbourhood. The staff here were fantastic and genuinely friendly as well. I stayed here just 2 nights but I know I'll be back again.",Vancouver
335488589,2015-12-28,"We stayed here for 2 nights. On the first night itself we found that our room heating system is not working. On our complaint EDDY responded quickly and moved us to another room that was warm and cosy. Thank you Eddy. Location is great, near to Metropolis mall and sky train station.Rooms are nice and spacious. Breakfast is very good.Our only frustration with this hotel was their heating system and elevator that are too slow to respond to card insertion and often moved before reading the card taking person to the wrong floor.Overall, we will come back here as this is good value for money.",Vancouver

Only complaints were that parking costs extra and this wasn't explained to us when we booked, or when we checked in.  We got a bill under our door the morning we left. Also, you have to pay for wireless internet, which I thought was kind of cheap.  I've stayed in many hotels less vaunted than this chain and have always had complimentary e-mail access.",Vancouver

The club lounge however was poor. XT club lounges leave a lot to be desired, this one being tight as it was a converted bedroom. Other brands have better lounges that include alcohol whereas XT charges for this. Not really worth the upgrade.",Vancouver

Hotel lobby is small, but clean. Staff were helpful and accommodated my early check in. My room was on a higher floor so street noise is virtually imperceptible.  The fitness centre is small with only 1 elliptical, 1 bike, 2 treadmills, a rower and some free weights - wish they would expand or offer a discount with GoodLife down the block.  Pool area could also use a refresh as pool was small, hot tub was ok, and they had a kiddie pool.  Havenâ€™t tried the restaurant yet, but willing to give it a look",Vancouver

A large mall was across the street that allowed me to pick up some items for the unexpected layover. Front desk staff were very helpful and provided a complimentary  overnight grooming kit. The room was not inexpensive but price was competitive to the other comparable options in Burnaby. The food in the restaurant/bar was good but the server could have used some help.,Vancouver

622433079,2018-10-05,First time to visit this hotel. We enjoy traveling with XT because of their high standards and also the rewards as a diamond member are always great.  the hotel upgraded us to a nice suite over looking the city from the top floor.  This is a great location that has almost everything you need. The hotel is at least 20 years old but well maintained. The second largest mall and Canada is located next door. Central transportation hub is also located at the small and it is convenient to get all over Vancouver. The staff were amazing and very friendly. We really enjoyed the secular launch with all of the goodies and the wonderful people working there   Will be back again next year and will stay here again ,Vancouver
203911099,2014-05-03,Spent a week here on business and the hotel is comfortable and quiet. There is some construction in the area but I did not hear a thing in my room which was nicely appointed and a very good value. The hotel is close to the skytrain which allows easy access to many areas around Vancouver including the waterfront and is right across from a mall complex. There are several restaurants within walking distance which also provide a good value.,Vancouver
412719698,2016-08-30,This hotel is not in Vancouver but it is easily access but the sky train which is also a cheap way to get around. We had no problems using and saw all that we had planned. We also did the hop of and off trolley which is a must to get to know more about Vancouver .  The staff at the hotel was very knowable and helped us to get sround . Unless you need to stay in town this hotel was very reasonable and a good alternative ,Vancouver

We spent a few nights before a cruise and then spent another week downtown afterwards so for us it was fine to spend the first few days in Burnaby and do some shopping at the mall. Thr neighborhood is safe, and had some ok reasturants closeby, like the trattoria and cactus clib cafe. The mall is huge. It's about 20 minutes on the skytrain to downtown and we had no problem getting there from the airport and to the cruise since it's close to the station.The breakfast was included and actually really good, with fresh berries and bagels etc. The rooms were fairly large and the view of a construction site was at least a big hit with our 2-year old. Same goes for the kids pool which was perfect for him.",Vancouver
256375139,2015-02-25,I was recently at a conference and stayed at this location. The check in is very easy and the staff very helpful in terms of finding us a local restaurant.

However, the hotel was clean, safe, and well situated with access by public transportation to Downtown Vancouver. The personnel, including wait staff at the hotel restaurant, were friendly, helpful (often above and beyond), and very accommodating. The food at the restaurant was probably the best hotel food we have ever had. We had a suite, which easily accommodated 3 of us. We were there for a Hearties Family Reunion, where everything was very well planned and executed. That added to the pleasure of our stay.",Vancouver
385929923,2016-06-25,"I stayed at this hotel before and after a scheduled cruise to Alaska.  Hotel is very clean, staff are friendly and helpful, and overall in good shape.  It's convenient to shopping at a large shopping mall across the street.  The one knock against the hotel is the lack of convenience to the ports/downtown Vancouver.  No shuttle service to the ports or airport.  I had mapped the distance of the hotel from downtown and it was not that far, but traffic makes it about a 30+ minute drive.  There is a sky train located across the street, which serves well if you don't have baggage.  My suggestion is to stay if your business does not require the cruise terminal.",Vancouver

It's decor style is a bit dated and service and feel is typical of a large chain, polite but impersonal.Noise levels are pretty awful with major building work going on across the road starting at 7am every day - not great when you're trying to manage jet lag.Bar area is busy and a nice plan to have a relaxed drink and bite to eat.

We have booked large functions there in the past as well as simple overnight getaways.  The service is excellent, the food is exceptional, and some of the menu choices are simply amazing.  I do not hesitate to recommend a stay at this property.

The location is handy to the nearby mall and the rail system. We booked tickets for a tour for the next day, the concierge stated he would book hem in the morning And call us to confirm, we waited until 10am. We waited in the room until 10am for the call and there was no call. I went down to the concierge desk and enquirer and found out that the tour was booked out and they had tried calling our room but there was no reply???? We had missed breakfast but the concierge on duty organised for us to have breakfast in the restaurant and he would get the manager to contact us to apologise. There was no call or apology from the manager. A waste of part of the day waiting around when we could have organised another tour. I have over 150 stays In XT properties and have never encountered such poor service.",Vancouver
459050310,2017-02-12,"We stayed here over the period leading to and after New Year's Eve.  The hotel is modern, comfortable, well equipped and the staff were fantastic.  The New Year's Eve function was terrific fun and well organised, and the views towards Vancouver from the higher floors were superb - especially when there was a huge dump of snow on New Year's Eve itself.  A good hotel and great service.  However, Metrotown is around a 30 minute drive from Vancouver downtown and all the things it has to offer, and whilst there is a good train service very nearby, if you are coming to visit and see Vancouver there are better located hotels and we found ourselves regularly commuting into town for what we wanted - it was OK because we had a car but it added complexity and meant I couldn't drink in the evenings because I had to drive to and from the various things we wanted to do downtown (like Roger's Arena and the hockey).",Vancouver

''Centrally Located  to the downtown area''?Actually, I was surprised and VERY disappointed to see just how far out this hotel was and wondered why they would build way out there. We stayed 2 nights prior to taking a cruise and it cost $75 and almost an hour by taxi to get from this hotel to the shipping terminal in Canada Place, which IS right downtown. There is the train but about 1km away through shopping centre, across main roads, over stairs, etc - way too much hassle with luggage.The hotel itself was nice enough and we were upgraded (being Diamond) to a quite-nice suite.

The suite was nice, what I would expect for a $200+ room in Vancouver but a little small and dated. As for executive, the only thing that seemed above any other room was the ice bucket, it was pretty. The Opal Lounge was anything but quiet as the hotel was fully booked, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was good.

Be aware that due to the garage being shared with a mall there will be heavy traffic during business hours.Close proximity to 2 large malls. Easy access to Vancouver and US border. ,Vancouver
249705968,2015-01-17,"I booked this hotel primarily because it was a XT on the Vancouver Metro, so I could easily get to events at the Convention Center and not pay $300+ US a night to be walking distance (my nightly rate was a third the downtown Hampton Inn).  Aside from the benefits of a XT business hotel, it's located near a major shopping center in Burnaby - and it sits on top of a Chinese shopping center ala Taipei!    So, dinner every night was Chinese market eats (the kiosks have great noodle bowls and pearl milk teas) at a fraction of the cost of a harborside restaurant.   A secondary benefit is greater proximity to the Vancouver airport, so in and out on early/late flights is more convenient.   Only downside is distance to downtown - it's in Burnaby - but if the Metro gets you proximal to you destination (and there are two different lines in from Metrotown, so there are lots of trains) it's worthwhile.",Vancouver

Though the staff was most courteous, there was little that was special, except the location. What we discovered on our own, without being told by staff, was that the hotel was smack in the middle of feeling like you are in Asia. We were able to walk out the second floor into a fascinating mall with markets and shops that barely showed a word in English. This made up for the mediocrity of the hotel. Great area to explore!

Patience is a virtue.Overall, I've stayed here many times and it's so convenient to have the mall across the street...you won't run out of great restaurants to hit up.

The service person didn't seem to care and did not explain how to use the hotel elevators with the door card. The hotel requires some serious renovations. The rest of the XT staff were pleasant and friendly. The hotel is close to Metrotown sky train station and Metropolis shopping mall. It takes less than 30 minutes to get to downtown Vancouver.

We have booked many times through a third party vendor and have never had an issue. This was the first time either one of us were denied a service that we have diamond XT membership privileges. The room was comfortable and reasonably quiet. Our room was not cleaned on our last day even though we left at 9:30am and returned at 9:00pm. The location is very good, close to the mall and sky train. Not sure I would stay again as I feel this is more of a 3.5 star hotel.",Vancouver

This hotel reminded me of a Holiday Inn in terms of decor, quality of furnishings and layout of the room.  I had a 1 bedroom suite with a master bed.  While the room was tidy it was very dated in terms of decor and furnishings....late seventies or early eighties.  Very basic.   I believe this place needs an update very soon.  The fitness centre on the 2nd floor is small but not any different in size than those of other hotels in this category.  I did eat at the restaurant for dinner one night and it wasn't too bad.  I would probably not stay here the next time I am in this part of the world.",Vancouver

415330583,2016-09-05,Front desk personnel were exceptional. Rm 930 is a corner room overlooking the park.  Everything worked in the room and it was spacious.  Th detailed local map provided by the front desk was invaluable as we had a longer stay than normal and used to for local shopping.  Easy walk to the Metrotown Skytrain.  25 minutes to the last stop which is the Vancouver waterfront.  The town of Burnaby should not be overlooked.   &quot;Fitness Center&quot; as labeled by XT is really a small room with 5 aerobic machines and some free weights.  Very crowded 630 to 8 a.m.    Opal Lounge is small but adequate.  The breakfast is very good.   Alcohol in the lounge is quite expensive. There is an alcohol tax and XT charges by the ounce for wine and spirits.  Go to a nearby store on the map they give you.   Overall good value for the experience.  USD was trading at .78  to the Canadian dollar at the time we stayed there.,Vancouver

Easy drive to downtown, or one block from the elevated train platform and Mall Metropolis at Metrotown, which takes you downtown for $1.75.  Some construction across the street, but it should not discourage you from staying here.  Close walk to two different grocery stores for snacks or a bottle of wine from the BC liquor store (room has a bottle opener).

There are NO restaurants  unless you like the food court!! It was an HOUR bus ride from here to Stanley Park. It was a 1/2 hour train ride with 1/2 hour of walking to get to Stanley Park. Also the hotel is under construction. Looks terrible coming in!  The rooms are nice and the hotel is clean. That's why the 3 stars and not 0. Room wise the hotel is fine.

Showering is done in the bath tub, but to drain the water, the drain valve should be elevated manually continuously, otherwise the drain closes itself directly. The cleaning service is very good. There are a few downsides however. Breakfast isn't having a lot of choice (almost no veggies, for example). The gym inside the hotel is very, very small, with only 3 cardio machines and dumbbells. You may use the gym across the street in the community center building. Staff is very attentive and friendly. For a XT hotel, I would have expected more facilities. ",Vancouver

While the day rate is not cheap per se, it is more affordable than the full-day price. And hey, you definitely get what you pay for.For one, the premises are securer than other inns I've visited. The elevator only works when a patron inserts their room key in a slot; every floor after the second is accessible only by elevator. I kinda felt like James Bond, which is an extra perk, I suppose.The room I was given had a giant window with an excellent view of the snow-blanketed mountains in the distance and the bustling Metrotown shopping complex down below.

I know all hotels are pretty busy on a July Sat night in Vancouver due to the cruise and travel season, but Stephanie was so kind and told me to leave it with her.  Sure enough her promise came thru and we got an extremely wonderful suite on the 16th floor.  ",Vancouver

I am a diamond club member with access to the executive lounge on he 18th floor. The lounge was well stocked with good selection of food and drinks with great views of the mountains.  My room was very clean with lots of space.  The only grip is the Dinner room service menu is limited in selection. It needs to be larger with more vegetarian dishes. .   Overall, the experience is very good.",Vancouver

You would have thought that since it was an honesty bar, so people were paying for it, they could have offered more choice.  So we went down tot he hotel bar where I found an excellent Merlot.

I stay at all XT brands from Waldorf down through Hampton Inn for a total of maybe 75 nights a year. I would never use the same scale to grade a XT as I would a Hampton Inn. I think I have a pretty clear understanding of what to expect at each brand hotel in the chain.This is a very good XT. It would be a great Doubletree, but it is not a Waldorf.Modern, clean, fast internet, good service and the 18th floor Honors lounge was a very good one. No complaints at all. Will stay here again.

The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion and soap.We breakfasted in the Executive Lounge/Dining Room except for one morning where we ate in the main restaurant.  The service was excellent and friendly, and the food was good with plenty of choice in both.The location of the hotel was the best thing - it was within a short walking distance of trains and buses which proved to be very efficient, including links to the airport.All in all, a good base for experiencing downtown Vancouver, which is a lovely city.",Vancouver

As others have mentioned, the hotel is in Metrotown, and is attached to the Crystal mall, which is a very very Chinese shopping center.  The second floor of the mall has direct access to the food court of the mall, which if you want to have a variety of Chinese/Asian food, is great.  We like it.  It was like being in Asia, but where everyone speaks English.  Greater Vancouver can be accessed via the metro which is a short walk from the hotel.  The overall area around the hotel also has a very Asian flavor as well, with Asian supermarkets also located in the general area.  As others have mentioned, the hotel is about 30 minutes in terms of a metro ride to downtown, and can be busy as this is a major commuter line (well, there are only a few lines, so all of them are busy at rush hours).

After arriving here, I was disappointed to find that there are no upgrades for golds, and only diamonds have access to the business lounge. Not just that I was unlucky tonight (its dead here)  - that is their everyday policy. Just wanted to send the head's up for other golds out there who may be considering this property.
