* Completed previous Labs


## Task 1: Create OIC Instance

1. In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console navigation menu, go to **Developer Servicese**, and then select **Integration** under **Application Integration**.

   ![Navigate to Integration page](./images/navigate-to-integrations.png " ")

2. In the Integrations page, select the compartment you want to create the bucket and click create instance button.

    ![Create Instance](./images/create-integration-button.png " ")

3. Fill the fields with name "call-center-demo" or any name your choice and keep the other fields as default

    ![Create Instance detail fields](./images/create-integration.png " ")

4. Now the Instance is created and wait for its state to change from **Creating** to **Active**. Once the state changes to active, open the integration details page by clicking on it and then click the service console button to open the OIC console page
    ![Open OIC Service console page](./images/integration-details.png " ")

5. Download the already created integration files [Transcribe Audio Files](./files/call-center-analytics-transcribe-audio-files-integration.iar) and [Process Transcriptions](./files/call-center-analytics-process-transcriptions-integration.iar) to use in Task 2 and Task 3. 

## Task 2: Setup Speech Transcription Integration
In this lab, we will implement an integration in which, upon uploading the audio file, the pipeline will be initiated, the transcription job will be created, and the output will be saved to the TranscriptedFiles bucket.

1. In the service console, open the hamburger menu and click **Integration** and then **Integrations** again to open integrations home page.
