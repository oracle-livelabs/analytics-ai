* Create a Forecast, Trend line, and Clusters

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Access to Oracle Analytics Cloud
* [Sample Order Lines DS](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/J6wePlhCmLfKoZRTdaMTEKerOCkYrnN3cPd4-g899hTOureVn6tHRZ048xjb4tTv/n/idtlyhmtj68r/b/LiveLabFiles/o/Sample Order Lines DS.xlsx) dataset

## Task 1: Create a Forecast and Trend line

1. From the homepage, click **Create** and select **Workbook.**

7. Select **January 2023** from the list and then check the **Exclude** box. Since our data for January 2023 is incomplete, it will mess up our forecast. Click away from the filter options.
