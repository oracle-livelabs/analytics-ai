# Connect to Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a connection to the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse from your Oracle Analytics Cloud instance.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create a connection to an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Access to Oracle Analytics Cloud
* Access to an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse

## Task 1: Download database connection wallet
In this section, you will download the Autonomous Data Warehouse wallet file which will be used to connect to the Autonomous Data Warehouse within Oracle Analytics Cloud.

4. In the connection dialog, enter the following:

	* Connection Name: Semantic Modeler
	* Description:
	* Client Credentials: Select the wallet zip file you downloaded in task 3
	* Username: ADMIN
	* Password: (The ADMIN password you created for the ADW)
	* Service Name: This will auto load once you upload the wallet
	* System connection: Check
