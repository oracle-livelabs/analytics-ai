# Introduction

## Overview

Are you interested in learning Machine Learning (ML)?  How about doing this in the context of the exciting world of F1 racing?!  Get your ML skills bootstrapped here with Oracle and Red Bull Racing!

This workshop teaches ML analytics using the [OCI Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/data-science.htm) service in [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/).

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
- Obtain data by your own (Data Extraction)
- Analyze the data (Data Exploration)
- Join multiple data sources (Data Merging)
- Train a ML model (Model Training)
- Deploy a ML model online and make real-time predictions according to the model (Model Deployment)


There is some infrastructure that must be deployed before you can enjoy this tutorial. We mention an automated way to deploy infrastructure [in the next lab.](#next)


### Prerequisites

You must have an OCI account. [Click here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/?source=:ow:o:s:nav::DevoGetStarted&intcmp=:ow:o:s:nav::DevoGetStarted) to create a new cloud account.

This solution is designed to work with several OCI services, allowing you to quickly be up-and-running:
* [Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/data-science.htm)

There are required OCI resources (see the [Terraform documentation](../dev/README.md) for more information) that are needed for this tutorial.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
