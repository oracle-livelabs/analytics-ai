# Setup the database

## Introduction

In this lab, we are going to create an Autonomous Database instance (ADB), load it with data and configure additional resources for our agent to be able to access the database.

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create an ADB instance.
- Create the database schema.
- Insert data into the database.
- Create a vault to securely store the database connection information.
- Create a database connection.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Completed the previous labs.

## Task 1: Create an ADB instance

In this task we are going to create a new ADB instance.

1. Click the navigation menu on the top left.
1. Click **Oracle Database**.
1. Click **Autonomous Database**.

   ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the ADB](./images/navigate-to-adb.jpg)

1. Under the **List scope** section, make sure that the **root** compartment is selected.
1. Click the **Create Autonomous Database** button at the top of the **Autonomous Databases** table.

   ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the create ADB page](./images/create-adb-button.jpg)

1. For the **Display name** use: _customer-support_.
1. For the **Database name** use: _customersupport_.
1. Under the **Compartment**, make sure that the **root** compartment is selected.
1. Under **Workload type** make sure that **Data Warehouse** is selected.

   ![Screenshot showing how to configure the display & database names](./images/create-adb-1.jpg)

1. Under the **Database configuration** section, enable the **Developer** option.
1. Select **23ai** as the version under **Choose database version**.

   ![Screenshot showing how to configure the developer option](./images/create-adb-2.jpg)

1. Under the **Administrator credentials creation** section, type a password (for example: _myPassword123_), in the **Password** field and confirm the password in the **Confirm password** field. Please make sure to choose a password you'd remember as we are going to need to type this password later.
1. Under the **Network access** section, make sure that the **Secure access from everywhere** option is selected.

   ![Screenshot showing how to configure admin password and network access](./images/create-adb-3.jpg)

1. Click the **Create** button at the bottom of the screen.

Once the database instance is created, you can move on to the next task (this may take a few minutes).

## Task 2: Create the database schema

In this task we are going to use SQL scripts to create the database schema which consists of tables and sequences (which will take care of inserting unique values for the various IDs like the ticket ID or customer ID etc.).

1. Once the ADB instance is created, click the **Database actions** drop down and select the **SQL** option. This should launch a new tab in your browser with the SQL application (dismiss any messages if you see any).

   ![Screenshot showing how to launch the SQL database action](./images/database-actions.jpg)

1. Copy the following sql statements, paste them into the **SQL worksheet** and click the green **Run Statement** button at the top.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    CREATE TABLE Customers (
        CustomerID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
        LastName VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
        Email VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        Phone VARCHAR2(20),
        Address VARCHAR2(200)
    );

    CREATE TABLE SupportAgents (
        AgentID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
        LastName VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
        Email VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        Phone VARCHAR2(20)
    );

    CREATE TABLE TicketStatus (
        StatusID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
        StatusName VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE Tickets (
        TicketID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
        CustomerID NUMBER NOT NULL,
        Subject VARCHAR2(200) NOT NULL,
        Description CLOB NOT NULL,
        CreatedDate DATE DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
        LastUpdatedDate DATE DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
        StatusID NUMBER NOT NULL,
        AssignedToAgentID NUMBER,
        FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
        FOREIGN KEY (StatusID) REFERENCES TicketStatus(StatusID),
        FOREIGN KEY (AssignedToAgentID) REFERENCES SupportAgents(AgentID)
    );

    CREATE SEQUENCE CustomerSeq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
    /
    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER CustomerTrigger BEFORE INSERT ON Customers FOR EACH ROW BEGIN SELECT CustomerSeq.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.CustomerID FROM DUAL; END;
    /
    CREATE SEQUENCE AgentSeq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
    /
    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER AgentTrigger BEFORE INSERT ON SupportAgents FOR EACH ROW BEGIN SELECT AgentSeq.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.AgentID FROM DUAL; END;
    /
    CREATE SEQUENCE TicketSeq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
    /
    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TicketTrigger BEFORE INSERT ON Tickets FOR EACH ROW BEGIN SELECT TicketSeq.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.TicketID FROM DUAL; END;
    /
    CREATE SEQUENCE StatusSeq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
    /
    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER StatusTrigger BEFORE INSERT ON TicketStatus FOR EACH ROW BEGIN SELECT StatusSeq.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.StatusID FROM DUAL; END;
    </copy>
    ```

   You should see an output similar to the following:

   ![Screenshot showing the successful output of the schema creation](./images/schema-creation-output.jpg)

## Task 3: Insert data

In this task we are going to fill the database tables with data.
One after the other, copy each of the following SQL sections, <u>in order</u>, and paste each statement into the **SQL worksheet**, <u>replacing any existing text</u>. After the statement has been pasted, click the **Run Statement** button.

   ![Screenshot showing how to execute an insert statement](./images/execute-insert-statements.jpg)

It is important to make sure that you only copy & execute a single section at a time.
Don't forget to select all of the text in the worksheet before executing the statement.
After you execute a statement look for an output similar to the following:
