# Workshop Introduction and Overview                                    

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps involved in building a **Data Pipeline** using **Orace Big Data Service (BDS)**. We will be donning multiple hats during this workshop.  

First we'll don the role of a **Data Engineer**. As this persona we'll Cleanse and Transform raw data present in Oracle Object Storage and store it in a particular form into an Object Storage bucket using Spark that we offer as a part of Big Data Service. Then we'll store this data in an external **Hive** table. The data set that we are going to use is the famous Taxi Data Set.

Next we'll wear the hat of a **Data Scientist**, where we'll launch a **Jupyter notebook** that is also offered as a part of the service. We'll build a model and save it.

Finally we'll wear the hat of a **Business Analyst** where we visualize this data using **Oracle Analytics Cloud**.

Estimated Workshop Time: 6 hours

## What is Oracle Big Data Service?
Oracle Big Data Service is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service designed for a diverse set of big data use cases and workloads. From short-lived clusters used to tackle specific tasks to long-lived clusters that manage large data lakes, Big Data Service scales to meet an organizationâ€™s requirements at a low cost and with the highest levels of security.

* Vertically integrated for Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark using Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub.
* Highly secure and highly available clusters provisioned in minutes.
* Expand on premise Hadoop; deploy test and development to the cloud.
* Any scale using high performance bare metal or cost effective virtual machine (VM) shapes.
* End-to-end data management; use with Autonomous Database, Analytics Cloud, OCI Streaming, OCI Data Catalog, OCI Data Science, and OCI Data Flow.
* Use Oracle SQL to query across Hadoop, Object Stores, Kafka, and NoSQL with Cloud SQL.

### Workshop Objectives
- Prepare for using Oracle Big Data Service (BDS).
- Create a simple (non-HA) Oracle Distribution including Apache Hadoop (ODH) Oracle BDS cluster using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console (OCI) and Big Data Service (BDS).
- Access a BDS utility node using a public IP address.
- Use Cloudera Manager (CM) and Hue to access a Big Data Service (BDS) cluster and add ingress rules to the default security rule that enables you to access both CM and Hue.
- Map the private IP address of the first master node in your cluster to a new public IP address to make this node publicly available on the internet and create a Hadoop Administrator user.
- Cleanse data uploaded in CSV format in Oracle Object Storage and upload the same to Object Storage and Hive Database.
- Run the Machine Learning code using BDS Jupyterhub Notebook and make predictions with test data.
- Visualize the data using Oracle Analytics Cloud.
- Clean up all of the resources that you created in this workshop (optional).
