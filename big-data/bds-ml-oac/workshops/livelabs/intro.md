# Workshop Introduction and Overview                                    

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using **Oracle Big Data Service (BDS)**.

Estimated Workshop Time: 4 hours

## What is Oracle Big Data Service?
Oracle Big Data Service is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service designed for a diverse set of big data use cases and workloads. From short-lived clusters used to tackle specific tasks to long-lived clusters that manage large data lakes, Big Data Service scales to meet an organizationâ€™s requirements at a low cost and with the highest levels of security.

* Vertically integrated for Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark using Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub.
* Highly secure and highly available clusters provisioned in minutes.
* Expand on premise Hadoop; deploy test and development to the cloud.
* Any scale using high performance bare metal or cost effective virtual machine (VM) shapes.
* End-to-end data management; use with Autonomous Database, Analytics Cloud, OCI Streaming, OCI Data Catalog, OCI Data Science, and OCI Data Flow.
* Use Oracle SQL to query across Hadoop, Object Stores, Kafka, and NoSQL with Cloud SQL.

## Workshop Objectives
- Review how to create some OCI resources that are required to get started with BDS.
- Create a simple (non-HA) Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH) Oracle BDS cluster using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console (OCI) and Big Data Service (BDS).
- Add Cloud SQL to the cluster and maintain your cluster.
- Access a BDS utility node using a public IP address.
- Use Cloudera Manager (CM) and Hue to access a Big Data Service (BDS) cluster and add ingress security rules to the default security rule that enables you to access both CM and Hue.
- Map the private IP address of the first master node in your cluster to a new public IP address to make this node publicly available on the internet and create a Hadoop Administrator user.
- Upload data to Hadoop Distributed File System.

## Workshop Prerequisites
This workshop requires an active *Oracle account* and a LiveLabs reservation as described in the **Getting Started** lab in the **Contents** menu.

## Launch the Workshop

> _**Note:** It can take up to 20 minutes to create your workshop environment._

1. When your LiveLabs workshop reservation is ready, you will receive an email with the subject **Your Livelabs reservation has been created (event #)**.
