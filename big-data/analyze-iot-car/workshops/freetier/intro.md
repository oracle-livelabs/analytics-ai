# Workshop Introduction and Overview

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to Analyze IoT Car using Flink/Kafka/Spark in **Oracle Big Data Service (BDS)**.

Estimated Workshop Time: 3 hours

## What is Analyze IoT Car using Flink/Kafka/Spark in Big Data Service Workshop?

This workshop's labs will guide you through the intricacies of processing and analyzing data using BDS. Initially, you'll familiarize yourself with Flink's capabilities to access real-time data from Kafka and process it. Subsequently, this data will be analyzed and the results will be stored in MySQL. For non-real-time data, Spark SQL will be employed to extract it from MySQL, followed by an analysis, the results of which will again be saved in MySQL. Finally, the Oracle Analytics Cloud will serve as your tool to visualize the analyzed data.

## Workshop Objectives

- Initialize the BDS Environment.
- Monitor Real-Time Truck Driving.
- Identify Hazardous Road Segments.
- Analyze Driving Patterns.

## Lab Breakdown
