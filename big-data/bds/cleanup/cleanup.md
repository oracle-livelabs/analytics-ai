# Clean up Resources Used in this Workshop (Optional)

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to delete the resources that you created in this workshop. If you want to run the labs in this workshop again, perform these clean up steps.

**Note:**
If you are using a **Free Trial** account to run this workshop, Oracle recommends that you at least delete the BDS cluster that you created when you complete the workshop, to avoid unnecessary charges.

Estimated Lab Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives

* Delete your **`training-cluster`** Big Data Service Cluster.
* Delete the resources that you created in your **`training-compartment`** as part of this workshop. This includes your IAM group, IAM user, IAM policies, VCN, reserved IP addresses, object storage bucket and its objects, and so on.
