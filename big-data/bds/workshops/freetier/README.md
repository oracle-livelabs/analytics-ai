# Welcome to the Getting Started with Oracle Big Data Service Hands-on Workshop!

The **Getting Started with Oracle Big Data Service (BDS) workshop** is a series of step-by-step labs that guide you through the process of setting up a simple environment and creating a small BDS cluster. You'll also explore with adding Cloud SQL to the cluster, accessing the cluster from the public internet, using Ambari and Hue to access the cluster, and creating a Hadoop administrator user.
