# Workshop Introduction and Overview

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using **Oracle Big Data Service (BDS)**.

Estimated Workshop Time: 6 hours

## What is Oracle Big Data Service?

Oracle Big Data Service is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service designed for a diverse set of big data use cases and workloads. From short-lived clusters used to tackle specific tasks to long-lived clusters that manage large data lakes, Big Data Service scales to meet an organizationâ€™s requirements at a low cost and with the highest levels of security.

* Vertically integrated for Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark using Oracle Distribution
  including Apache Hadoop(ODH).
* Highly secure and highly available clusters provisioned in minutes.
* Expand on premise Hadoop; deploy test and development to the cloud.
* Any scale using high performance bare metal or cost effective virtual machine (VM) shapes.
* End-to-end data management; use with Autonomous Database, Analytics Cloud, OCI Streaming, OCI Data Catalog, OCI Data Science, and OCI Data Flow.
* Use Oracle SQL to query across Hadoop, Object Stores, Kafka, and NoSQL with Cloud SQL.

## Workshop Objectives

- Prepare for using Oracle Big Data Service (BDS).
- Create a Highly-Available (HA) Oracle Distribution including Apache Hadoop(ODH) Oracle BDS cluster using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console (OCI) and Big Data Service (BDS).
- Add Cloud SQL to the cluster and maintain your cluster.
- Access a BDS utility node using a public IP address.
- Use Ambari and Hue to access a Big Data Service (BDS) cluster and add ingress rules to the default security rule that enables you to access both Ambari and Hue.
- Map the private IP address of the first master node in your cluster to a new public IP address to make this node publicly available on the internet and create a Hadoop Administrator user.
- Upload data from your master node in your cluster to new HDFS directories and new object storage buckets.

## Workshop Prerequisites

This workshop requires an Oracle Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account or you can get a Free Trial account as described in the **Getting Started** lab in the **Contents** menu.

*Note: If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)***

**Notes:**
