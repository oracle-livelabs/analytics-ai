# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The requirements of many companies' business objectives demand the processing of very large volumes of data, in many different formats and imported from a large number of sources. To efficiently manage this information flood we need an high performance, integrated platform capable of minimizing transformations and copies while keeping secure and easy access to data.

Oracle Cloud Data Lakehouse fully meets these challenges and becomes the primary, integrated platform for your data management and data analytics offering performance, availability and security.

The Oracle Cloud Data Lakehouse LiveLab will demonstrate a typical usage scenario, highlighting some of the tools in  building the foundation of the data lake house.

Estimated Time: 70 minutes
