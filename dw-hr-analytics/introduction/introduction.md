## Introduction

**Departmental Data Warehouse - HR Analytics**

Lines of business like the Human Resources department typically don't have timely or efficient access to data and information. Analysts gather the data manually, work with it on an individual basis, and then share copies of files through email or file servers. With Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Analytics Cloud, you can load and optimize data from a multitude of sources into a centralized data warehouse for analysis so departments can gain actionable insights.

This solution uses data in an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and then uses Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) to analyse the data to provide actionable insights.

This workshop will guide you through the installation of HR schema on the Oracle Autonomous Database. Thereafter, you will learn how to connect ADW to OAC and then perform analysis with some refined data.

Estimated Time: 75 minutes

### Objectives
1. Provision the infrastructure required for HR analytics.
2. Analyse data using OAC.

### Prerequisites
- Access to a paid or a Livelabs Oracle Cloud account.
- Necessary permissions to be able to provision the stack in a compartment.

## Labs
Lab 1 - Provision Resources (30 minutes)

- Login to the OCI console and provision the required resources.

Lab 2 - Perform Analysis - Create Dashboards (45 minutes)

- Connect Analytics instance to ADW.
- Upload DVA file to OAC.

**You are all set. Let us begin!**
