    - [HumanResources.dva](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/HumanResource.dva)
    - [hr.sql](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/hr.sql)

**Note:** Please download the files above before continuing.

## Task 1: Installing HR Schema on Autonomous Database

1. Use SQL Developer to connect to your database as the ADMIN user. The steps to do so can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/connect-sql-dev182.html#GUID-14217939-3E8F-4782-BFF2-021199A908FD).

2. Run the following code to create the HR user. You should replace MYpassword12 in the statement below with a password of your choosing.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    CREATE USER HR IDENTIFIED BY MYpassword12;
    
    GRANT DWROLE TO HR;

    ALTER USER HR QUOTA UNLIMITED ON DATA;
    </copy>
    ```

3. Now go ahead and log in as the HR user, then run the hr.sql script to install the HR schema. 

4. The following tables should be visible: EMPLOYEES, LOCATIONS, JOBS, COUNTRIES, DEPARTMENTS, REGIONS, JOB_HISTORY

    ![List of Created Tables](./images/created-tables.png "List of Created Tables")
    
## Task 2: Setting up the Human Resource Analytics Project in OAC

1. Login to your analytics cloud instance. The URL can be found on the page of the instance. Refer to the previous lab for instructions on how to get to your analytics cloud instance.

    ![Go to Analytics Home Page](./images/go-to-analytics-home-page.png "Go to Analytics Home Page")

2. Click on the ellipses menu in the top right corner, select **Import Workbook/Flow**. Then click on **Select File** and choose the HumanResources.dva file.

    ![OAC Home Page](./images/oac-home-page.png "OAC Home Page")
    
    ![Import Workbook](./images/import-workbook.png "Import Workbook")

    ![Select File](./images/select-file.png "Select File")

3.  Import the file into OAC by clicking on **Import**. The password is **Admin123**. Hit **OK** to close the dialog. 

    ![Import](./images/import-dva.png "Import")

    ![Import Successful](./images/dva-import-successful.png "Import Successful")

4. Click on the navigation menu icon in the top left. Go to **Data** and open the **Connections** tab. You should see a connection named **adw_hr**. 

    ![Go to Data](./images/go-to-data-page.png "Go to Data")

    ![Select Connections](./images/go-to-connections-tab.png "Select Connections")

5. Click on the ellipses menu on the extreme right of the connection entry and select inspect.

     ![Inspect Connection](./images/inspect-connection.png "Inspect Connection")

6. Click on the **Select** button in front of Client Credentials and select the wallet to your ADW instance. Let the username be **hr** and provide the database password. Click **Save** and then **Close**.

    ![Update Connection Credentials](./images/update-connection-credentials.png "Update Connection Credentials")

7. You will now refresh the data sets to utilise the connection. Select the **Data Sets** tab and you will see all the tables appear below. Go ahead and reload each data set by clicking on the ellipses menu to the right of the data set entry and selecting **Reload Data**. Wait until the reload for all the data sets is complete.

    ![Reload Data Sets](./images/reload-data-sets.png "Reload Data Sets")

8. Now proceed to the hamburger menu and select **Catalog** and open your project. The visualisations should load, but click **Refresh Data** if needed to refresh the visuals.

5. Select the **AttritionPrediction** data set and click on **Add**.

    ![Select AttritionPrediction](./images/select-attrition-prediction.png "Select AttritionPrediction")

6. Next, drag the **Save Data Set** option from the **Data Flow Steps** on the left, and move it right next to the Attrition Prediction data set in the panel at the top. Provide a name to the Data Set. In the **Save Data To** drop down, select **Database Connection**. 

    ![Save Data Set to Database](./images/save-to-database.png "Save Data Set to Database")

5. Click on **Select connection** and choose the **adw_hr** connection. Thereafter, also give a name that would be used for the table in the database.

    ![Choose Connection](./images/choose-connection.png "Choose Connection")

6. Hit the **Run Data Flow** button at the top. You will be prompted to save the data flow. Give it a name and click on **OK**.

    ![Save and Run Data Flow](./images/run-data-flow.png "Save and Run Data Flow")

The data flow should run and upon successful execution you should be able to see the two data sets under the **Data** menu item.

![Created Data Sets](./images/created-data-sets.png "Created Data Sets")

## Task 4: Using Attrition Data set in the Human Resource project

1. Open the Human Resource workflow. Click on the edit button to enter the edit mode. From the data panel, click on the encircled **+** sign and select **Add Data Set**.

    ![Edit Dashboards](./images/edit-dashboard.png "Edit Dashboards")
    
    ![Add Data](./images/add-data-to-canvas.png "Add Data")

    ![Select AttritionPrediction Data Set from Database](./images/select-data-set-from-database.png "Select AttritionPrediction Data Set from Database")

3. Click on the **+** sign next to the canvas names at the bottom of the screen to add a new canvas. 

    ![Create New Canvas](./images/create-canvas.png "Create New Canvas")

4. Right click on the name of the new canvas and choose **Rename**. Give the canvas a meaningful name.

We will now leave it to your imagination to analyse the data sets that have been provided to you.

*Congratulations! You have successfully completed the lab*.
