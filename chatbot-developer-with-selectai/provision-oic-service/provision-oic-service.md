# To Integrate Weather API in Oracle Integration Cloud Service (OIC)

## Introduction

This lab will take you through the steps needed to provision Oracle Integration Cloud Service and integrate OIC with the Weather API

Estimated Time: 120 minutes

### About OCI Integration Cloud Service

Oracle Integration Cloud Service is a complete, secure, but lightweight integration solution that enables you to connect your applications in the cloud. It simplifies connectivity between your applications, and can connect both your applications that live in the cloud and your applications that still live on premises. Oracle Integration Cloud Service provides secure, enterprise-grade connectivity regardless of the applications you are connecting or where they reside.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* SignUp for Weather API which is publicly available
* Provision Oracle Integration Cloud Service
* Integrate the Weather API using OIC by configuring connections and importing integration

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* All previous labs successfully completed
* Must have an Administrator Account or Permissions to manage several OCI Services: Oracle Integration Cloud Service

## Task 1: Signup for Weather API

This task will help you ensure that the required access to the Weather API using the API Key is available. If the API Key access is not there, please get the API keys as follows.

The weather API provides Real-time or current weather access to near real-time weather information for millions of locations worldwide by global collaborations of weather stations and high resolution local weather models.
