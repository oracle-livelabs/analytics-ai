# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop helps to configure and deploy a cutting-edge chatbot solution utilizing a multi-api architecture to revolutionize conversational AI. Each API/Tool brings unique capabilities, combining to create an intelligent and versatile system.

Using this workshop, the developers can create multiple Database APIs (connecting through Oracle REST Data Services - ORDS) and third-party APIs (connecting through OCI Integration Cloud Service - OIC), and expose them through an OCI Digital Assistant (ODA) Chatbot. 

The Database APIs can be data retrieval NL2SQL APIs (using Autonomous Database Select AI) or data addition APIs. The Autonomous Database can be accessed by an APEX App.

When the user asks question in natural language, then the ODA Chatbot leverages Generative AI Tools to dynamically orchestrate and route the user’s request to appropriate API, and thereby fetches the correct response to user’s question.

This solution implements OCI Generative AI Multi-step Tool, so it also supports tool-calling in a sequence. The output of one tool can be the input to another tool. Thus this solution can even support highly complex questions, that requires leveraging multiple different Tools/APIs together.

This multi-tool approach offers a powerful and flexible framework for developers to create next-generation conversational AI applications, catering to a wide range of user needs.

### Objectives

Objective of this workshop is to set-up the required OCI services to create a Multi Tool/API Chatbot solution for Database NL2SQL operations.

![Architecture Diagram](images/chatbot_developer_arch.png)

* Oracle Autonomous database – World's first autonomous database that is self-driving, self-repairing, self-securing.
* Oracle APEX - Low-code development environment that enables users to quickly build and deploy a wide range of business applications.
* OCI Integration Cloud (OIC) - Users can use Oracle Integration Cloud to pull a city's weather information leveraging Weather API.
* OCI Digital Assistant (ODA) – Users can create ODA Digital Assistance and import the provided ODA Skills for DB APIs and OIC APIs. Users can then connect from ODA chatbot and get responses of their natural language questions.
* OCI Visual Builder (VB) ATOM Application – User can create OCI Visual Builder (VB) instance and import ATOM VB web application.
Users can then embed the ODA chatbot in ATOM VB application, and interact with the ODA Chatbot.

In this workshop, you will learn how to:


* Provision Autonomous Database and enable Select AI.
* Create a sample APEX app and add REST Services.
* Setup & configure Oracle Integration Cloud to integrate with Weather API.
* Setup & configure Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA) as an OCI Generative AI powered chatbot.
* Setup & configure Visual Builder as a frontend channel for ODA.
* Test out the features and capabilities of this Visual Builder application.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud Account
* Access to OCI Integration Cloud (OIC)
* Access to OCI Digital Assistant (ODA)
* Access to OCI Visual Builder (VB)
* Access to OCI Autonomous Database (ADB)
* Access to a Region where the Generative AI service is available: Chicago, Frankfurt
* Must have an Administrator Account or Permissions to manage several OCI Services: Generative AI Services, Digital Assistant, Visual Builder, Autonomous Database, Integration Cloud, Dynamic Groups, Policies, Identity Access Management, Resource Manager

* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is helpful
