# Setup OCI Digital Assistant (ODA)

## Introduction

This lab will take you through the steps needed to provision Oracle Digital Assistant Cloud Service

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### About OCI Digital Assistant

Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA) is a platform that allows you to create and deploy digital assistants for your users. Digital assistants are virtual devices that help users accomplish tasks through natural language conversations, without having to seek out and wade through various apps and web sites. Each digital assistant contains a collection of specialized skills. When a user engages with the digital assistant, the digital assistant evaluates the user input and routes the conversation to and from the appropriate skills.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Provision an ODA instance.
* Import and configure ODA Rest API Services to connect to different solution components.
* Import and configure ODA Digital Assistant and ODA Skills to use different solution components.
* Create a Channel to connect the ODA Digital Assistant to a frontend.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* All previous labs successfully completed
* Must have an Administrator Account or Permissions to manage several OCI Services: Digital Assistant

## Task 1: Provision Oracle Digital Assistant

This task will help you to create Oracle Digital Assistant under your chosen compartment

1. Locate Digital Assistant under AI Services.

## Task 2: Dynamic Group & Policy creation for Oracle Digital Assistant

This task will help you to create desired dynamic group & necessary policy for the Oracle Digital Assistant

1. Attach the policy at the root compartment level. Please change the values of OCIDs to your own values here.

    ```text
    <copy>
    Allow any-user to use ai-service-generative-ai-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    Allow any-user to use generative-ai-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    Allow any-user to use fn-invocation in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    </copy>
    ```

    > **Note:**
    > * Please make sure that the compartmentId should be the one under which the resource is  created.

## Task 3: Create REST Services for the ODA Skills

This task involves creating REST service which will be used by ODA to connect to the endpoints for Select AI, Generative AI, APEX and OIC services

1. Download the four REST Service Configurations.

    a. [RESTService-DBSelectAIService.yaml](https://objectstorage.us-chicago-1.oraclecloud.com/n/idb6enfdcxbl/b/Excel-Chicago/o/Livelabs%2Fgenai-multi-agent%2FRESTService-DBSelectAIService.yaml)

    b.  [RESTService-DBAddRegionDataService.yaml](https://objectstorage.us-chicago-1.oraclecloud.com/n/idb6enfdcxbl/b/Excel-Chicago/o/Livelabs%2Fgenai-multi-agent%2FRESTService-DBAddRegionDataService.yaml)

    c. [RESTService-CohereToolChatServiceV2.yaml](https://objectstorage.us-chicago-1.oraclecloud.com/n/idb6enfdcxbl/b/Excel-Chicago/o/Livelabs%2Fgenai-multi-agent%2FRESTService-CohereToolChatServiceV2.yaml)

    d. [RESTService-OIC\_Weather\_Service.yaml](https://objectstorage.us-chicago-1.oraclecloud.com/p/HIomV4YoAvkW7IqNJA_T7KqSFb6ZxX21ObHS9jBchxkCa8_J0tcEJ-UErkj_Ij9I/n/idb6enfdcxbl/b/Excel-Chicago/o/Livelabs/genai-multi-agent/RESTService-OIC_Weather_Service.yaml)

2. Locate the ODA instance (created in Task 1).

    ![ODA locate](images/oda_locate.png)

3. Select the ODA Instance and click on Service Console.

    ![ODA service console](images/oda_service_console.png)

4. In the ODA Console, click on hamburger menu. Under Settings, click API Services.

    ![ODA API Services](images/oda_api_services.png)

5. Click on More -> Import REST Services.

    ![ODA import rest services](images/oda_import_rest_services2b.png)

    **Note** Import all Rest Services:
    - The DBSelectAIService Rest API service (using "RESTService-DBSelectAIService.yaml")
    - DBAddRegionDataService Rest API service (using "RESTService-DBAddRegionDataService.yaml")
    - CohereToolChatService Rest API service (using "RESTService-CohereToolChatServiceV2.yaml")
    - OIC\_Weather\_Service (using "RESTService-OIC\_Weather\_Service.yaml")

7. In the DBSelectAIService Rest API service, update the Endpoint field by replacing '< REST ENDPOINT HERE >' with the ORDS endpoint (Lab 2 Task 4) url up to the "/:prompt". Do not include the "/:prompt".
    ![ODA DBSelectAIService api](images/oda_rest_db_select_ai.png)

8. Test the DBSelectAIService Rest API service, by clicking on the Test Request button. You should see Response Status 200, with a proper Response Body. 

   ![ODA DBSelectAIService api test](images/oda_rest_db_select_ai_test.png)

9. In the DBAddRegionDataService Rest API service, update the Endpoint field by replacing '< APEX REST ENDPOINT HERE >' with the APEX endpoint (Lab 2 Task 1) url.

    ![ODA DBAddRegionDataService api](images/oda_db_add_region_api.png)

10. Test the DBAddRegionDataService Rest API service, by clicking on the Test Request button. You should see Response Status 200, with a proper Response Body. 

    ![ODA DBAddRegionDataService api test](images/oda_db_add_region_test.png)

11. For the OIC\_Weather\_Service, update the Endpoint (from Lab 3 Task 4 Step 28), UserName/Password (from Lab 3 Task 3 Step 6), click on the pencil icon to change the value of the city parameter to London, and then test the service using the Test Request button. You should see Response Status 200.

    Endpoint URL should have the format "https://****/getTemperature1?city"
