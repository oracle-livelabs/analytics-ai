1. Create all 50 DB users with script in SQL tool (using ADMIN user)

2. Through OML user admin, set the email address on all the 50 users.
Maybe needs to be manual. No problem.

3. Need to create real email addresses, because will receive email to activate it.


3. Through OCI create the users.

4. In OAC add the correct application role.

Assumptions:
- Users will use their own schema (on the same ADW instance)
- Users will do their own data loading (so they can see benefits of ADW)
- Users will do their own ML on ADW (again, so they can see the benefits)
- Users will create their own connection from OAC to ADW

To find out: 
- Can users see each others stuff in OAC??

Result:
- Data load can be done by individual users:
https://gda8def9ae64db4-redbull3.adb.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/pl1/_sdw/
(replace pl1 with the name of actual user)
- OML can be access with:
https://gda8def9ae64db4-redbull3.adb.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloudapps.com/oml/

Questions:
- Any problems running notebook server (Zeppelin) for this many users on same instance?
- Any problems with running DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL simultaneously from many users in difference schemas, on same instance?
