# Introduction

Estimated Lab Time: 5-10 minutes

## Overview

One day, I woke up and said: how hard could it be to integrate Machine Learning into Gaming, an industry where everything is already software? I started researching the most popular games and, with some gaming experience I had growing up, I decided to look deeper into League of Legends.

Long story short, after some months of developing my League of Legends API wrapper (making calls to the official API with functions I created myself), I started extracting data from professional players with the hopes of creating a Machine Learning predictor that would tell me how I was performing in a match **during and after** the match itself.

This is what this workshop is going to teach you.

We're going to create two models:
- _Offline Model_: we'll obtain after-match data, and compare how well we did to pàst professional games. This will be a good model to **theorize** about which characters are good/bad in the long run.
- _Live Client Model_: we'll obtain **real-time** data from a match, run it through our model, and return a winning probability (0-100)%.

## Introduction to League of Legends

League of Legends is a team-based strategy game in which two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other’s base. As a player, you can choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory. To win, you'll need to destroy the enemy’s Nexus—the heart of each team's base.

Access and mobility play an important role in LoL. Your team needs to clear at least one lane to access the enemy Nexus. Blocking your path are defense structures called turrets and inhibitors. Each lane has three turrets and one inhibitor, and each Nexus is guarded by two turrets. In between the lanes is the jungle, where neutral monsters and jungle plants reside. The two most important monsters are Baron Nashor and the Drakes. Killing these units grants unique buffs for your team and can also turn the tide of the game.

Team composition depends on five positions. Each lane lends itself to certain kinds of champions and roles—try them all or lock into the lane that calls you. Champions get stronger by earning experience to level up and buy more powerful items as the game progresses. Staying on top of these two factors is crucial to overpowering the enemy team and destroying their base.
