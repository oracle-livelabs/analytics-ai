# Setup OCI Digital Assistant (ODA)

## Introduction

This lab will take you through the steps needed to provision Oracle Digital Assistant Cloud Service

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### About OCI Digital Assistant

Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA) is a platform that allows you to create and deploy digital assistants for your users. Digital assistants are virtual devices that help users accomplish tasks through natural language conversations, without having to seek out and wade through various apps and web sites. Each digital assistant contains a collection of specialized skills. When a user engages with the digital assistant, the digital assistant evaluates the user input and routes the conversation to and from the appropriate skills.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create Dynamic Group and Policy to enable ODA connectivity to other OCI Services.
* Provision an ODA instance.
* Import and configure ODA Rest API Services to connect to different solution components.
* Import and configure ODA Digital Assistant and ODA Skills to use different solution components.
* Create a Channel to connect the ODA Digital Assistant to a frontend.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* All previous labs successfully completed
* Must have an Administrator Account or Permissions to manage several OCI Services: Digital Assistant

## Task 1: Dynamic Group and Policy Definition

This task will help you configure the Dynamic Group and Policy.

These Dynamic Group and Policy Definition are for single-tenancy deployment - where ODA and Generative AI Agent are in the same tenancy.

For Policy Definitions required for multi-tenancy deployment (where ODA and Generative AI Agent are in different tenancies), please refer to Task 7.

1. Locate Domains under Identity & Security

    ![Domain Navigation](images/locate_domain.png)

2. Click on your current domain name

    ![Click Domain](images/click_domain.png)

3. Click on Dynamic Groups, and then your Dynamic Group name

    ![Click DG](images/click_dg.png)

    **Note** The name of your dynamic group can be different.

4. Ensure that your Dynamic Group is properly defined - as follows. Then click on Identity

    ![DG Details](images/dg_details.png)

    **Note** The resource.compartment.id should be set to the OCID of your Compartment - that is having your ODA Instance.

5. Click on Policies, ensure that you are in your "root" compartment, then click on your Policy name

    ![Click Policy](images/click_policy.png)

    **Note** The name of your policy can be different.

6. Ensure that your Policy is properly defined - as follows.

    ![Policy Details](images/policy_details.png)

    ```
    allow dynamic-group <dynamic-group-name> to manage agent-family in tenancy
    allow dynamic-group <dynamic-group-name> to manage genai-agent-family in tenancy
    allow dynamic-group <dynamic-group-name> to manage object-family in tenancy
    ```

    **Note** If you are using a non-default identity domain - then instead of of just indicating the dynamic group name, you need to indicate domain-name/group-name in the policy statements.

7. Attach the policy at the root compartment level. Please change the values of OCIDs to your own values here.

    ```text
    <copy>
    Allow any-user to use ai-service-generative-ai-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    Allow any-user to use generative-ai-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    Allow any-user to use fn-invocation in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    </copy>
    ```

    > **Note:**
    > * Please make sure that the compartmentId should be the one under which the resource is  created.

## Task 2: Provision Oracle Digital Assistant

This task will help you to create Oracle Digital Assistant under your chosen compartment.

1. Locate Digital Assistant under AI Services

If the Policy Definitions are not correctly defined, please define them as follows.

**Required Information:**

* _ODATenancyOCID_ - The OCID of the Tenancy, where the ODA Instance is created.

    In the OCI Console, you can click on your profile icon in the top right corner, click on your Tenancy name, and then copy the OCID of the tenancy.

    ![Tenancy OCID](images/tenancy_ocid.png)

* _ODAInstanceOCID_ - The OCID of the ODA Instance.

    In the OCI Console, you can go to your Digital Assistance instance (Menu -> Analytics & AI -> Digital Assistant), and then copy the OCID of the       ODA instance

    ![ODA Instance OCID](images/oda_instance_ocid.png)

1. In the tenancy where the ODA instance is hosted - Locate Policies under Identity & Security, ensure that you are in your "root" compartment, and      then define the following policies.

   ```
   <copy>
    endorse any-user to manage agent-family in any-tenancy where request.principal.type='odainstance'
    endorse any-user to manage genai-agent-family in any-tenancy where request.principal.type='odainstance'
    endorse any-user to manage object-family in any-tenancy where request.principal.type='odainstance'
    </copy>
   ```

   ![ODA Instance Policy](images/create_policy.png)

2. In the tenancy where the Generative AI instance is hosted - Locate Policies under Identity & Security, ensure that you are in your "root"
   compartment, and then define the following policies.

   _Please ensure to replace the ODATenancyOCID and ODAInstanceOCID with the proper OCID values._

   ```
   <copy>
    define tenancy oda-instance-tenancy as ODATenancyOCID
    admit any-user of tenancy oda-instance-tenancy to manage agent-family in tenancy where request.principal.id in ('ODAInstanceOCID')
    admit any-user of tenancy oda-instance-tenancy to manage genai-agent-family in tenancy where request.principal.id in ('ODAInstanceOCID')
    admit any-user of tenancy oda-instance-tenancy to manage object-family in tenancy where request.principal.id in ('ODAInstanceOCID')
    </copy>
   ```
