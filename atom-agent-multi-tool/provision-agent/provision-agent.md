# Lab 1: Provision and Configure GenAI Agent

## Introduction

This lab will walk through the steps of writing access policies to the agent service, deploying and configuring a Generative AI Agent, and deploying a function application. 

Estimated Time: 120 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Make sure that our tenancy is subscribed to the Chicago region.
* Create the required permissions for us to be able to use the service in our tenancy.
* Provision GenAI Agent
* Configure Tools for Agent in console UI
* Provision Functions Application

### Prerequisites (Optional)

This lab assumes you have:

* Access to the Chicago Region
* Administrator permissions or permissions to use the Generative AI Agents, Digital Assistant, Functions, Visual Builder and Identity Domains

## Task 1: Ensure Chicago region subscription

The OCI Generative AI Agents service is currently only available in the Chicago region.
If your tenancy is already subscribed to the Chicago region, please skip to the next task.

1. On the top right, click the Regions drop down menu.

  ![Screenshot showing the tenancy regions list](./images/policies/regions-list.png)

1. Review the list of regions your tenancy is subscribed in. If you find the **US Midwest (Chicago)** region in the list, please skip to the next task.

1. Click the Manage Regions link at the bottom of the list.

1. In the **Infrastructure Regions** list, locate the **US Midwest (Chicago)** region and click the subscribe button to it's right.

  > **Note:** When you subscribe to a region, you cannot unsubscribe from it.

  ![Screenshot showing the region subscription page](./images/policies/infrastructure-regions.png)

1. Click the **Subscribe** button at the bottom of the **Subscribe to New Region** dialog.

  ![Screenshot showing the new region subscription approval dialog](./images/policies/subscribe-new-region-dialog.png)

The operation might take a few minutes to complete. When complete, the new region will appear on the **US Midwest (Chicago)** will appear in the **Regions** drop down menu on the main screen.

## Task 2: Create access policies

In this task, we are going to create policies which will grant us access to the OCI Generative AI Agents service as well as the Object Storage service.
We will use Object Storage to store the dataset required for this workshop.

First, we are going to create a dynamic group which will allow us to grant access to the OCI Generative AI Agent service to the dataset uploaded to Object Storage.

1. Click the navigation menu on the top left.

1. Click **Identity & Security**.

1. Click **Domains**.

  ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the domains section of the console](./images/policies/domains-navigation.png)

1. Under the **List scope**, make sure that the **root** compartment is selected.

1. Click the **Default** domain from the **Domains** table.

  ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the default domain section](./images/policies/default-domain-navigation.png)

1. On the left click **Dynamic Groups**.

1. Click the **Create dynamic group** button at the top of the **Dynamic groups** table.

  ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the dynamic groups section](./images/policies/dynamic-group.png)

1. Name the dynamic group (example: oci-generative-ai-agents-service)

1. Provide an optional description (example: This group represents the OCI Generative AI Agents service)

1. Select the **Match all rules defined below** option in the **Matching rules** section.

1. Enter the following expression in the **Rule 1** textbox:

    ```text
    <copy>
    all {resource.type='genaiagent'}
    </copy>
    ```

  ![Screenshot showing how to configure the dynamic group](./images/policies/create-dynamic-group.png)

Next, we will create the access policies:

1. Click **Identity & Security**.

1. Click **Policies**.

  ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the policies section](./images/policies/policies-navigation.png)

1. On the left under **List scope**, select the root compartment. The root compartment should appear first in the list, have the same name as the tenancy itself and have the text **(root)** next to it's name.

1. Click the **Create Policy** button on the top left of the **Policies** table.

  ![Screenshot showing how to initiate the creation of a new policy](./images/policies/create-new-policy-navigation.png)

1. Provide a name for the policy (example: oci-generative-ai-agents-service).

1. Provide a description (example: OCI Generative AI Agents CloudWorld 2024 Hands-On-Lab Policy).

1. Make sure that the root compartment is selected.

1. Enable the **Show manual editor** option.

1. In the policy editor, enter the following policy statements:

  ```text
  <copy>
  allow group <your-user-group-name> to manage genai-agent-family in tenancy
  allow group <your-user-group-name> to manage object-family in tenancy
  allow dynamic-group <dynamic-group-name-created-above> to manage all-resources in tenancy
  </copy>
  ```

  Make sure to replace `<your-user-group-name>` with the user group your user is associated with (for example: `Administrators`).
  Also, please replace `<dynamic-group-name-created-above>` with the name you've provided for the dynamic group created above.

  ![Screenshot showing the steps to create a new policy](./images/policies/create-new-policy.png)

## Task 3: Verify access to the service

1. On the top right, click the Regions drop down menu.

1. Click the **US Midwest (Chicago)**.

1. Verify that the appears in bold to indicate it is the active region.

  ![Screenshot showing how to select the Chicago region from the regions list](./images/policies/select-chicago-region.png)

1. Click the navigation menu on the top left.

1. Click **Analytics & AI**.

1. Click **Generative AI Agents** under **AI Services**.

  If the **Generative AI Agents** service does not appear under **AI Services**, please review previous tasks.

  ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the Agents service from the main menu](./images/policies/agents-service-navigation.png)

## Task 4: Provision Oracle Object Storage Bucket

This task will help you to create Oracle Object Storage Bucket under your chosen compartment. This will be used for the RAG tool.

1. Locate Buckets under Object Storage & Archive Storage

    ![object storage navigation](images/kb/os_nav.png)
