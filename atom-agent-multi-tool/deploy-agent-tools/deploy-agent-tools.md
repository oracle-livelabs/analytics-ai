# Lab 2: Deploy Agent Tools

## Introduction

This lab will go through the steps on configuring the GenAI Agent tools. First we'll go through the steps needed to provision the RAG tool, then we'll set up the Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai and Database Tools Connection. Once the DB is provisioned, we'll define the tools through the console. After the tools are configured we will deploy a function that invokes the agent service. The function we deploy will be used in the next lab.

The following agent tools will be configured: 
* General LLM Chat (Built-in)
* Document Understanding
* Weather
* RAG 
* SQL

Estimated Time: 120 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Deploy VCN and subnet for ADB
* Create Vault to store DB secret
* Define agent tools in the OCI console
* Deploy agent functions to function application
* Provision an Oracle ADB 23ai
* Create DB Tools Connection

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account
* All previous labs successfully completed
* Must have an Administrator Account or Permissions to manage several OCI Services: Oracle Databases, Networking, Policies.

  > **Note** Tasks 2-8 are for the sql tool. If you don't plan on using the sql tool, you can skip these steps. 

## Task 1: Add Agent Routing Instructions and Create RAG Tool 

1. Navigate to your GenAI Agent created in the previous lab 

![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the Agents service from the main menu](./images/console/agents-service-navigation.png)

2. Edit your agent and add the following routing instructions: 

    ```text
     <copy>
      You are a helpful assistant. If user asks about <info on your dataset>, use the rag tool. If user asks about employees, use atomlivelab-sql tool. If user asks about the weather, use the weather tool. If user asks a general question, use your general knowledge, no tools.
     </copy>
    ```

    > **Note** Be sure to replace "info on your dataset" above with a relevant term to your knowledge base to help the agent route to the correct tool. In our example, our dataset relates to wines.

3. Select your agent and create a new tool 

![Create RAG Tool](./images/rag/create-rag-tool.png)

4. Give a description of the tool and select the knowledge base you created in the previous lab 

![Configure RAG Tool](./images/rag/config-rag.png)

5. Navigate to the agent endpoint and launch the chat. You should now be able to ask questions about your dataset -

## Task 2: Dynamic Group and Policy Definition for ADB and DB Tools Connection

This task will help you ensure that the Dynamic Group and Policy are correctly defined.

1. Locate Domains under Identity & Security

    ![Domain Navigation](images/adb/locate_domain.png)

2. Click on your current domain name

    ![Click Domain](images/adb/click_domain.png)

3. Click on Dynamic Groups, and then your Dynamic Group name

    ![Click DG](images/adb/click_dg.png)

    > **Note** The name of your dynamic group can be different.

4. Ensure that your Dynamic Group is properly defined - as follows. Then click on Identity

    ![DG Details](images/adb/dg_details.png)

    ```text
     <copy>
      ALL {resource.type='genaiagent'}
     </copy>
    ```

5. Click on Policies, ensure that you are in your "root" compartment, then click on your Policy name

    ![Click Policy](images/adb/click_policy.png)

    > **Note** The name of your policy can be different.

6. Ensure that your Policy is properly defined - as follows. Make sure to change the compartment to your own compartment name where the respective services are hosted. 

    ![Policy Details](images/adb/policy-details.png)

    ```text
     <copy>
      Allow dynamic-group <your-dynamic-group> to read database-tools-family in compartment <comp-with-database-connection>
      Allow dynamic-group <your-dynamic-group> to read secret-bundle in compartment <comp-with-vault-secret>
      allow any-user to read database-tools-family in compartment <database-connection-comp> where any {request.principal.type='genaiagent'}
      allow any-user to read secret-bundle in compartment <vault-comp> where any {request.principal.type='genaiagent'}
      Allow any-user to use database-tools-connections in compartment <database-connection-comp> where any {request.principal.type='genaiagent'}
     </copy>
    ```

    **Note** If you are using a non-default identity domain - then instead of of just supplying the dynamic group name, you need to provide domain-name/group-name in the policy statements.

## Task 3: Create VCN and Private Subnet

This task will help you to create a VCN and private subnet in your compartment. This will be used for the ADB for the SQL Tool.

1. Go to Networking -> Virtual cloud networks and Create VCN. Provide IPv4 CIDR Blocks as 10.0.0.0/16

2. Go to the newly created VCN and click on Create Subnet. Provide IPv4 CIDR Block as 10.0.1.0/24 and click on Private Subnet. You can leave rest as default. Click on Create Subnet.

3. Click on newly created subnet and go to the Security List. Add following ingress rules in the security list. Make sure to have the ingress rule to access database port 1521-1522

    ![Ingress Rules](images/adb/ingress_rules.png)

## Task 4: Create Vault to store database secrets

This task will help you to create vault which would be used to save secrets for the database. The secrets are used for the agent to connect to your database with the db tool connection.

1. Locate Vault under Key Management & Secret Management. Provide Name and click on Create Vault.

    ![Vault](images/adb/create_vault.png)

2. Go to the newly created Vault. Click on Create Key.

3. Provide Name and leave rest as default. Choose Protection Mode as HSM and click on Create Key.

4. Finally provide a valid email ID and click on Create Autonomous Database.

## Task 6: Create Database Tools Connection

This task involves creating a Database Tools Connection which will be used to query the database using SQL Worksheet.

1. Locate Database Tools Connections under Developer Services. Click on Create connection.

    ![Create conn](images/adb/dbconn.png)

2. Provide Name and Compartment information. Choose Oracle Autonomous Database as Database cloud service. Provide Username as admin.

3. Click on Create password secret. Provide Name, Vault and Key created in Task 3. Provide same password used at the time of ADB creation in previous task.

    ![Create Password](images/adb/dbconn_pass.png)

4. Use the newly created password secret as User password secret.

5. Copy the connection string from your autonomous database. Go to ADB and click on database connection and copy any of the low, medium or high connection strings as shown below,

    ![Create Conn String](images/adb/conn_string.png)

6. Modify the connection string with the following: Reduce retry_count form 20 to 3; Replace host with private ip address. You can get Private IP address from the autonomous database as shown below.

    ![Private IP](images/adb/pvt_ip.png)

7. Click on Create private endpoint. Provide Name and private subnet created in Task 1.

    ![Private Endpoint](images/adb/dbconn_pvt_endp.png)

8. Choose newly created private endpoint as Private Endpoint.

9. Choose Wallet format as None in SSL details.

10. Click on Create to create a database tools connection.

    ![Create DBTools](images/adb/dbconn_create_conn.png)

11. Go to newly create Database Tools connection. Click on Validate.

    ![Validate DBTools](images/adb/dbconn_validate.png)

## Task 7: Create and Populate Employee Table

1. Navigate to the SQL Worksheet of your newly created ADB and run the following statements: 

> **Note** You can create or use your own tables here; we provided the table below for illustration purposes. 

```text
<copy>
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentID INT,
    HireDate DATE NOT NULL
);
</copy>
```

- Populate your table with the following data 

```text
<copy>
INSERT ALL
INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID, HireDate) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 1, TO_DATE('2020-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID, HireDate) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 2, TO_DATE('2020-02-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID, HireDate) VALUES (3, 'Bob Johnson', 1, TO_DATE('2020-03-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID, HireDate) VALUES (4, 'Alice Brown', 3, TO_DATE('2020-04-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID, HireDate) VALUES (5, 'Mike Davis', 2, TO_DATE('2020-05-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
SELECT * FROM dual;
</copy>
```

  > **Note** If you use your own table, large queries can cause timeouts in the agent service & ODA. Try filtering your results to avoid timeouts.

## Task 8: Create SQL Tool
1. In the console navigate to your agent and create a new SQL Tool

  ![Navigate to Agent](./images/console/agents-service-navigation.png)

2. Enter name e.g. atomlivelab-sql and description, along with the database schema 

> **Note** Make sure to use the same schema defined from the previous task.

```text
<copy>
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentID INT,
    HireDate DATE NOT NULL
);
</copy>
```

> **Note** If you are using your own table, you can get a better idea of the schema by running DESC table_name;

![Create SQL Tool](images/sqltool/create-tool.png)

3. Select Oracle SQL as the dialect and select the database tool connection configured in the previous task. Enable SQL Execution and self correction. 
4. Test the connection 

![Test Connection](images/sqltool/tool-connection.png)

5. Create the tool 

6. Navigate to your endpoint and launch the chat. Ask a question such as "Give me list of employees". The agent should invoke the SQL Tool and convert the query to Oracle SQL, then return the result - 

  ![Test SQL Tool](./images/sql/test-sql-tool.png)

  ![Test SQL Tool](./images/sql/test-sql-tool-2.png)

  > * **Note** If your sql tool is not returning the correct response, it can be helpful to provide an in-line example to the tool. Also see [SQL Tool Guidelines](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/sqltool-guidelines.htm#sqltool-iclexamples)

  > * **Note** Also make sure your agent is using the correct tool for the job. If the agent is using the wrong tool, make sure to add a more detailed description and/or routing instructions.

  > * **Note** If you are getting 404 errors, you are likely missing a policy. Refer back to Task 1 step 6. 

  > * **Note** If you are querying a large table and getting 100+ rows of results, the query will fail. Try adding more filters to your query to reduce size of response. 

## Task 9: Create a Weather Tool

  1. Navigate to your agent tools and create a new tool called "get_weather" 

  - Give the following description - 

    ```text
    <copy>
      Get the weather for a given location
    </copy>
    ```

  - Paste the following function parameters - 
    ```text
    <copy>
    {"type":"object","properties":{"location":{"type":"string"}},"required":"['location']"}
    </copy>
    ```

  2. Create the tool 

## Task 10: Deploy Function to Function Application

The function to be deployed will invoke the agent from the ODA application.

In this section, we will delve into the process of creating and deploying an Oracle Function. OCI Functions provide a serverless environment, allowing you to focus on your code without worrying about server management. We will guide you through the steps of developing and deploying an OCI Function, which can be a powerful tool for extending your application's capabilities. You will learn how to create a function, configure its settings, and deploy it using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console or command-line interface. By the end of this section, you will be ready to connect the function to the ODA skill.

1. Download the following file: 

    [Agent ADK Fn](https://objectstorage.us-chicago-1.oraclecloud.com/n/idb6enfdcxbl/b/Livelabs/o/atom-multi-tool-livelab%2Fgenai-fn-livelab.zip)

2. Navigate back to your function application created in the previous lab.

3. Select Getting Started > Cloud setup and take note of the steps to login and deploy the functions.

    ![Fn Cloud Setup](images/fn-deploy/cloud-shell.png)

    - This will give you your specific instructions for: 
        - Setting the context
        - Logging in to the container registry 
        - Deploying the function to your application

   > **Note:** You don't need to run the last invoke command. We will be invoking the function later from ODA. 

4. At the top right of the oci console, open a new cloud shell

    ![Open Cloud Shell](images/fn-deploy/open-cloud-shell.png)


5. Select the gear icon at the top right of the shell and upload the zip file from step 1 

    ![upload-zip-cloudshell.png](images/fn-deploy/upload-zip-cloudshell.png)

6. Create a new directory for your agent multi tool function and move the zip to the directory

``` text 
<copy>
    mkdir genai-fn-livelab
    mv genai-fn-livelab.zip /genai-fn-livelab
    cd /genai-fn-livelab
    unzip genai-fn-livelab.zip
</copy>
```

7. open the func.yaml and enter your agentEndpointId

``` text 
<copy>
    vi func.yaml 
</copy>
```

  - Press 'i' to insert your changes then press escape then ':wq' to save your changes. 

  > **Note** Your agentEndpointId is *not* the same as your AgentId. Please make sure you use the endpoint id.

8. Deploy the function 

  ``` text 
  <copy>
      fn -v deploy --app <your-function-app>
  </copy>
  ```

  - Take note of the function invoke endpoint once created

![Deployed Function](images/fn-deploy/deploy_function.png)

> **Note** If you get an error with the architecture, you can change the architecture from the cloud shell 

![Change Architecture](images/fn-deploy/change-architecture-cs.png)

> **Note** Functions can sometimes time out when invoked for the first time (cold start). To avoid this, you can enable provisioned concurrency on your function to enable hot starts. 

![Provisioned Concurrency](images/fn-deploy/provisioned-concurrency.png)

9. You may now **proceed to the next lab**
