# Tune our ChefGPT

## Introduction

Now that our dataset is clean and tokenized, and we've seen how the untuned t5 model is performing, let's train our own chef GPT model using 5,000 recipes available in our training dataset.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Load the model in it's untuned state
* Observe the various parameters which can be used in the training process
* Execute the training process
* Observe the various training stages

### Prerequisites

* You have completed the tasks in all of the previous labs

## Task 1: Download the notebook & upload it to your notebook environment

1. Download the following notebook: [tune-chefgpt.ipynb](files/tune-chefgpt.ipynb).
1. Locate the notebook in your download folder and drag it to your notebook environment. Please make sure to navigate to the correct folder (`/hol/`).
1. Once the notebook has been uploaded, right click it on the left to open it in your environment. We've added comments to the cells to help you better understand the code.

## Task 2: Make sure the right kernel is selected

1. Please make sure that you have the Conda environment that we have prepared in the first lab, selected.

## Task 3: Execute the code

1. Execute the cells one-by-one and observe the result.

## Task 4: Monitor the execution

1. If you'd like to see the GPU utilization during training (otherwise, proceed to step #2):

    1. Click on the terminal tab:

       ![Select terminal tab](images/open-terminal.jpg)

    2. If you do not have a terminal tab open, click on the plus icon on the top left:

       ![Click plus icon on the top left](images/click-plus-icon.jpg)

    3. In the `Launcher` page, select `Terminal` under the `Other` section:

       ![Select Terminal under the Other section](images/select-terminal.jpg)

    4. Once the terminal window opens, type the following command:

       ```bash
       <copy>gpustat -i</copy>
       </copy>
       ```

    5. You should see an output similar to this;

       ![GPU utilization output](images/gpu-utilization.jpg)

       The memory utilization should be close to 100% which means that we have selected an optimal batch size.

2. Click on the notebook tab and wait for the training process to complete.
   The `Training Loss` & `Validation Loss` should both report lower values with each training epoch.
   Otherwise, we will need to update the regularization techniques used to yield better results.

   Here's an example of how the expected results should look like:

## Task 5: Observe the saved model

1. Once training is complete, you can observe the saved file by clicking the the `fine_tuned_t5_recipes_base_5k` folder:

   ![Saved model folder](images/saved-model-folder.jpg)

   The model should appear like so:
