# Introduction

## Welcome to Bistro AI: Create an AI-Powered Recipe Generator

Looking for some culinary inspiration? Look no further than `ChefGPT`! When you find yourself with ingredients in the fridge and pantry but lacking ideas on how to transform them into a delicious meal, `ChefGPT` comes to the rescue. By harnessing the power of generative AI, this session will guide you in fine-tuning a large language model to generate recipes.

With a dataset of recipes as your foundation, you'll personalize the model, turning it into your very own `ChefGPT`. By running this customized model, you'll unlock a wealth of recipe ideas that prioritize maximizing deliciousness. Say goodbye to boring meals as you explore the world of generative AI and enhance your skills in the process.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Prepare and tokenize a dataset for large language model tuning
* Unsupervised tuning of a large language model
* How to use the tuned LLM
