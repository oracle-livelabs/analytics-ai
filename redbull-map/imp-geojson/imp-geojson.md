# Import your GeoJSON code into OAC 

## Introduction

In this lab you will **import the GeoJSON files** you generated into the OAC Console as a Map Layer.

_Estimated Time:_Â 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Import your GeoJSON files you have built in the previous lab
###  Prerequisites

- An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or Live Labs Cloud Account
- Provisioned Oracle Analytics Cloud
- All previous labs successfully completed
- Access to the console of OAC ("_BI Service Administrator Role_" Application Role)

6. Browse to your geoJSON file you created. If successful, you will see  a window asking for your layer name and which field you will use to map to your data. 

    In case you haven't created your own geoJSON, you can download [Zandvoort Sector LineString.geojson](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/jyHA4nclWcTaekNIdpKPq3u2gsLb00v_1mmRKDIuOEsp--D6GJWS_tMrqGmb85R2/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/Zandvoort%20Sector%20LineString.geojson)
    > **Note:** if your file does not upload successfully, ensure you entered in a unique id for each property.

7. Click **add Custom Map Layer** to load your second map layer

8. Browse to your second geoJSON file you created. If successful, you  will see a window asking for your layer name and which field you  will use to map to your data.

    In case you haven't created your own geoJSON, you can download [Zandvoort Sector Point.geojson](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/jyHA4nclWcTaekNIdpKPq3u2gsLb00v_1mmRKDIuOEsp--D6GJWS_tMrqGmb85R2/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/Zandvoort%20Sector%20Point.geojson)

You have now loaded your custom **Map Layers** into OAC.  
Next we will associate the LineStrings and Points to your data.

Congratulations on completing this lab!

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
