# Create a search user interface and run searches

## Introduction
In this lab you will create a user interface in Visual Builder that can be used to execute searches against the content that has been processed by the AI services and loaded into OpenSearch. A Visual Builder project has been prepared and you will upload this project, connect it to your environment, then use it. 

Estimated time: 20 min

### Objectives

- Create a user interface with Visual Builder and use it to query content that has been processed by the solution

### Prerequisites
- You've completed the previous labs

## Task 1: Download the project
1. You will need the VB application archive *opensearch-1.0.zip* for the next task. If you cloned the Git repo to your local computer in a previous lab, you will already have this file. This file is located in the *visual_builder* folder of the cloned repo. You can continue to the next task.

2. If you did not use the Git clone method to obtain the files, you can download the files using the OCI Console Cloud Shell using these procedures.

    1. In the OCI Console, select the **Developer Tools icon** and then select *Cloud Shell*.

    1. Click the **Cloud Shell Menu icon** and select *Download*.

    1. To download the Visual Builder project file to your local computer from the Cloud Shell, enter the file name below and click **Download**.
    ```
    <copy>
    oci-searchlab/vb/opensearch-1.0.zip
    ```

## Task 2: Import the project
1. Go to the Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) service console home page. If this is not already open in one of your browser tabs, you can get back to it by following these steps.
  
    1. Go the Cloud console 3-bar/hamburger menu and select the following    
        1. Developer Services
        1. Integration
  
    1. Check that you are in the intended compartment. (*oci-starter* was the recommended compartment name.)

    1. Click **oic** in the Integration instances list

    1. Click the **Service Console** button. It will open the OCI service console in a new tab.


1. In the OIC service console menu, choose **Visual Builder**.

1. Import the project file that you obtained in **Task 1**.
    1. Click *Import*
        ![Visual Builder Import](images/opensearch-vb.png)
        
    1. Click **Application from file**
        ![Visual Builder file](images/opensearch-vb-file.png)
    1. Choose the file *vb/opensearch-1.0.zip*
    1. Application Name: *opensearch*
    1. Application ID: *opensearch*
    1. Click **Import**

        ![Visual Builder Import](images/opensearch-vb-import.png)
    1. Wait for the import to be confirmed

## Task 3: Edit the connections

1. From the Visual Applications list, open the imported application by clicking on the application name, **opensearch**
![Visual Builder Import](images/opensearch-vb-applications.png)

1. To edit the connection to connect to the OpenSearch server, click on the **Service icon**

1. Click the **opensearch** connection 

1. Click on **Servers** tab

1. Click the **Edit icon** 
![Connection OpenSearch](images/opensearch-vb-connection-opensearch.png)

1. Use the ***APIGW_URL*** value you saved to your text file to fill in the Connection details:
    - (If you need to get the value, run this command in OCI Console Cloud Shell: oci-searchlab/starter/src/search_env.sh)

1. Configure the server as follows:
    - Replace Instance URL: *APIGW_URL*
      - Ex: https://xxxxxxxx.apigateway.eu-frankfurt-1.oci.customer-oci.com
    - Authentication: None
![Edit Connection OpenSearch](images/opensearch-vb-connection-opensearch2.png)

1. Click *Save*

1. Test the connection:
    1. Select tab *Endpoints*
    1. Click **Get - Get Many**
    1. Select tab *Test*
    1. Click **Send Request**

    ![Test Connection OpenSearch](images/opensearch-vb-connection-opensearch3.png)
    1. The test succeeded if you see *"successful": 1,* in the response

## Task 4: Test the application

1. Click the **run** button on the top right of the Visual Builder page. The Visual Builder application user interface will appear in a new browser tab.
![Run the application](images/opensearch-vb-test.png)

1. In the search user interface, enter *shakespeare* or *macbeth* or *candle* and click **Search**. This will return a record for the file that was processed by OCI Document Understanding AI service to extract text from the image file so that it could be made searchable.
![Test Result](images/opensearch-vb-test-result.png)

1. Notice the search results contain the file name, an excerpt of the text extracted from the file (although the full text is searchable), the file type, and the topic classification provided by the OCI Language AI service. You can click the file name to display it.
    
    **Note - since most web browsers don't natively display .tif files, if you attempt to open a .tif in the search results, you will be prompted to download it. You can then view it with an application on your local computer, if you have an app that can view .tif files.**

1. If you performed the optional task at the end of the previous lab and processed the additional files, you can query for those now. Here's some hints on words you can search for each of the provided documents. You can also search on *"\*"* to see all indexed documents.

    | File | Search Terms |
    | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | Image\_Map\_Brazil.png | brasil, rio |
    | Image\_Workshop\_architecture.png | streaming, "object storage" |
    | Invoice\_6879875\_scanned.tif | 6879875, bijou, 111.31 |
    | Invoice\_DS67076\_scanned.pdf | ds67076, champaign, pcanywhere, 709.63 |
    | Text\_DocU\_blog\_HTML\_to\_PDF.pdf | blogs.oracle.com, datascience |
    | Text\_DocU\_Overview\_PPTX\_to\_PDF.pdf | harbor, "product direction" |
    | Voice\_SupportRobot.mp3 | headphones, bluetooth, "consumer electronics", yesterday |
    | Shakespeare\_macbeth.tif | shakespeare, macbeth, candle, shadow |
    | Penguins.jpg | animal, beak, bird, penguin |
    | HOL\_summary.txt | workshop, oic, "document understanding" |




**Congratulations! You have completed this workshop.**

Here's what you accomplished. You provisioned multiple services into a compartment in your OCI tenancy. These included Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), several AI services (such as OCI Document Understanding and OCI Language), and Oracle Search with OpenSearch. You imported a project into OIC that ingests document files from Object Storage, sends them to AI services based on the file type, and then loads extracted data into an OpenSearch index. You configured all of the service connections used by that OIC project and then you ran the integration project. Finally, you imported an application project into Visual Builder, you configured the connection to OpenSearch, and then you ran the project to display a search user interface. You used that search tool to query the content added to the OpenSearch index. This workshop has illustrated how different OCI services can be integrated together to use AI to make many types of content more searchable.
