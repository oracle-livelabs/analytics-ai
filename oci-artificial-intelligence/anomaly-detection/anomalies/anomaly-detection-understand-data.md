#  Understand Data And Download Samples

## Introduction

Due to the nature of time-series anomaly detection, the data required for training any ML models needs to be formatted properly. Similarly here, our core ML algorithm behind our service has few basic requirements on the data to train an effective model.

In this session, we will discuss the data requirements and formats, and provide some sample datasets as examples. We will also show you how to upload to Oracle object storage for later to create data assets and train the model.

***Estimated Time***: 25 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Understand the data requirements and data formats for training and detecting with the model
- Be able to download prepared sample datasets
- Upload the downloaded dataset into OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) object storage

### Prerequisites

- A Free tier or paid tenancy account in OCI
- Familiar with OCI object storage to upload data

## Task 1: Understand Data Requirements

The core algorithm of our Anomaly Detection service is a multivariate anomaly detection algorithm, which has two major data quality requirements on the training data:

* For multivariate use case, the training data should be anomaly-free (without outliers) containing observations that have normal conditions. For univariate use case, the kernel can handle a small proportion of outliers.
* The training data should cover all the normal scenarios which contain the full value ranges on all attributes.

Additionally, the algorithm also has some requirements on data type, minimum number of attributes and observations on the training data as follows:

* The data should have a 2-D matrix shape for CSV format, which have:
    - columns containing one timestamp, and other numeric attributes/signals/sensors
    - rows representing observations of those attributes/signals/sensors at the given timestamps in the first column.
    - rows that are strictly ordered by timestamp, without duplicated timestamps.
* The training data can have 1 or more attributes, up to 300 attributes in the current release as of Feb 2023.
* At least one attribute does not have a missing value.
* The number of observations/timestamps in training data should be at least eight times the number of attributes or 80, whichever is greater.

The testing/detecting data is also required to only contain columns like timestamp and other numeric attributes that match with the training data set; observations are strictly ordered by unique timestamps. No further requirements on testing data.

For more details, please refer to the [Training and Testing Data Requirements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/anomaly/using/data-require.htm) section within OCI Anomaly Detection documentation.

### Data format requirement

The service accept multiple types of data source to train model, including Oracle Object Storage, Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), InfluxDB. Detailed document on how to use ATP or InfluxDB as data source can be referred at https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/services.htm .

Here we will use Oracle Object Storage data source as example to explain the requirement, since the main content are similar across different types of data source.

For Oracle Object Storage data source type, the service accepts two data formats: CSV format and JSON format. The data should only contain one timestamp and other numeric attributes, and timestamp has to be the first column, which satisfy the [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

#### CSV format
CSV-formatted data should have comma-separated lines, with first line as the header, and other lines as data. Note the first column is the timestamp column.

> **Note:**
* Missing value is permitted(with empty), data is sorted by timestamp, and boolean flag values should be converted to numeric (0/1).
* Do not have a new line as the last line. The last line should still be an observation with other attributes/signals.

Here is an example of CSV-formatted data:
```csv
timestamp,sensor1,sensor2,sensor3,sensor4,sensor5
2020-07-13T14:03:46Z,,0.6459,-0.0016,-0.6792,0
2020-07-13T14:04:46Z,0.1756,-0.5364,-0.1524,-0.6792,1
2020-07-13T14:05:46Z,0.4132,-0.029,,0.679,0
```

#### JSON format

Similarly, JSON-formatted data should also contain timestamps and numeric attributes only, with the following keys:

> **Note:**
* Missing value is coded as null without quote.

```json
{ "requestType": "INLINE",
  "signalNames": ["sensor1", "sensor2", "sensor3", "sensor4", "sensor5", "sensor6", "sensor7", "sensor8", "sensor9", "sensor10"],
  "data": [
      { "timestamp" : "2012-01-01T08:01:01.000Z", "values" : [1, 2.2, 3, 1, 2.2, 3, 1, 2.2, null, 4] },
      { "timestamp" : "2012-01-02T08:01:02.000Z", "values" : [1, 2.2, 3, 1, 2.2, 3, 1, 2.2, 3, null] }
  ]
}
```

**Prerequisites**
* The training data should cover all the normal system conditions with the full value ranges for all attributes/signals.
* The training data should not have abnormal conditions, which may contains anomalies.
* The attributes in the data should be correlated well or belong to the same system or asset. Attributes from different systems are suggested to train separate models.

## Task 2: Download Sample Data

Here are two sets of prepared sample data to help you to easily understand how the training and testing data looks like, Download the two files to your local machine.

Univariate datasets
* [training csv data](../files/demo-training-data.csv)
    - 1 signal with timestamp column, with 1,032 observations
* [testing csv data](../files/demo-testing-data.csv)
    - same 1 signal with timestamp column, 242 observations

Multivariate datasets
* [training csv data](../files/demo-training-data-multivariate.csv)
    - 10 signals with timestamp column, with 10,000 observations
* <a href="../files/demo-testing-data-multivariate.json" target="_blank" download>testing json data for detection</a>
    - same 10 signals with timestamp column, 100 observations

## Task 3: Upload Data to Object Storage

You need to upload the sample training data into Oracle object storage, to be prepared for model training in next steps.

Testing json data is not needed to upload to bucket, but is needed in detection UI later.

**Task 3a:** Create an Object Storage Bucket (This step is optional in case the bucket is already created)

First, From the OCI Services menu, click Object Storage.
![cloud storage bucket](../images/cloudstoragebucket.png " ")

Then, Select Compartment from the left dropdown menu. Choose the compartment matching your name or company name.
![create compartment](../images/createCompartment.png " ")

Next click Create Bucket.
![create bucket button](../images/createbucketbutton.png " ")

Next, fill out the dialog box:
* Bucket Name: Provide a name <br/>
* Storage Tier: STANDARD

Then click Create
![press bucket button](../images/pressbucketbutton.png " ")

**Task 3b:** Upload the Downloaded training csv data file into Storage Bucket

Switch to OCI window and click the Bucket Name.

Bucket detail window should be visible. Click Upload
![bucket detail](../images/bucketdetail.png " ")

Click on Upload and then browse to file which you desire to upload.
![upload sample file](../images/upload-sample-file.png " ")

More details on Object storage can be found on this page. [Object Storage Upload Page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/oci-core/object-storage/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=object-storage) to see how to upload.
