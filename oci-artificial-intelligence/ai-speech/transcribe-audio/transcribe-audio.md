## Introduction
In this session, we will help users get familiar with OCI Speech and teach them how to use our services via the cloud console.

***Estimated Lab Time***: 10-15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Understand a high level overview of the OCI Speech.
- Understand all the capabilities of OCI Speech.
- Understand how to analyze text using OCI Speech via cloud console.

### Prerequisites:
- A Free tier or paid tenancy account in OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)
- Tenancy is whitelisted to be able to use OCI Speech

## **Task 0:** **Policy Setup**

Before you start using OCI Speech, your tenancy administrator should set up the following policies by following below steps:

1. Navigate to Policies

    Log into OCI Cloud Console. Using the Burger Menu on the top left corner, navigate to Identity & Security and click it, and then select Policies item under Identity.
        ![Policy navigation menu](./images/cloud-identity-policy.png " ")


2. Create Policy

    Click "Create Policy
        ![Create policy button](./images/create-policy-button.png " ")


3. Create a new policy with the following statements:

    If you want to allow all the users in your tenancy to use speech service, create a new policy with the below statement:
        ```
        <copy>
        allow any-user to manage ai-service-speech-family in tenancy
        allow any-user to manage object-family in tenancy
        allow any-user to read tag-namespaces in tenancy
        </copy>
        ```
        ![create policy information window](./images/any-user-policy.png " ")


    If you want to limit access to a user group, first create a group

    Navigate to OCI groups:
        ![Naviagte group menu](./images/navigate-to-groups.png " ")

    Click "Create Group"
        ![Create groups button](./images/create-group.png " ")

    Add group name and description, click create
        ![Add Group name and description window](./images/group-name-description.png " ")

    To add users click "Add User to Group" and select user from dialog
        ![Add users to group button](./images/add-users-to-group.png " ")




    Create a new policy with the below statement:
        ```
        <copy>
        allow group group-name to manage ai-service-speech-family in tenancy
        allow group group-name to manage object-family in tenancy
        allow group group-name to read tag-namespaces in tenancy
        </copy>
        ```
        ![Create policy for group information window](./images/group-name-policy.png " ")

## **Task 1:** Navigate to Overview Page

        ![Create job button](./images/create-transcription-job.png " ")    

3. Enter Job Information on Basic Information Page

    This page is split into three sections

    <strong>Job information:</strong> Optionally enter a name and description for your job, as well as choose the compartment you want your job to be in

    <strong>Data:</strong> Select the bucket in object storage containing the files you want to transcribe and optionally choose where you want the output files to be stored and/or give a prefix to their file names

    <strong>Configure transcription:</strong> Choose the language that the audio you want to transcribe is in and optionally add filters by clicking the "Add filter" button.
        ![Job details selection page](./images/basic-information-page.png " ")

    Filters allow you to remove, tag or mask certain words from the transcription, such as profanity
        ![Filters selection page](./images/filters.png " ")

    Click "Next" to continue to file selection


4. Select Which File(s) From Object Storage to Transcribe in this Job

    Select one or more files to transcribe from the specified bucket in object storage then click "Submit"
        ![media selection page](./images/select-media-files.png " ")

5. View Newly Created Job in Jobs List

    Once the job is created you will be directed back to the jobs list page, where the newly created job will be at the top. Notice the status of the job will likely say "Accepted" or "In progress"

    Other possible job states are "Succeeded" "Failed" "Partially Succeeded" and "Canceled"

    You can use the state filter in the lower left to filter the jobs in the list based on these states
