# Lab 7: Convert Text to Speech in OCI Console and SDK

## Introduction

In order to use the OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) speech service you must upload formatted audio files to an OCI
object storage bucket

***Estimated Lab Time***: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Understand how to convert input text to audible speech as output

### Prerequisites
- A Free tier or paid tenancy account in OCI
- Tenancy is whitelisted to be able to use OCI Speech TTS
- Have completed Lab #4 API signing key and config file setup and Prerequisites and setup for python
- Familiar with Python programming is required
- Install with Python libraries: `oci` and `requests`

## Task 1: Navigate to Overview Page
Log into OCI Cloud Console. Using the Burger Menu on the top left corner, navigate to Analytics and AI menu and click it, and then select Language item under AI services.
    ![Navigate speech service menu](./images/nav-to-speech.png " ")

This will navigate you to the transcription jobs overview page.
On the left you can toggle between overview and transcription jobs listing page.
Under documentation you can find helpful links relevant to OCI speech service
    ![Speech service overview page](./images/overview-page.png " ")

## Task 2: Open Text to Speech and Generate Audio

1. Click "Text to Speech" in the side menu.
    ![Speech service overview page](./images/nav-to-tts.png " ")

2. Now you should be seeing the TTS page with default values. The Input text box will be filled with default text which can be edited as per requirement.
        ```
        <copy>
        A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
        </copy>
        ```
    ![TTS service default page](./images/tts-overview-page.png " ")

3. Click on *Generate* button to generate the audio file, Which you should be able to play with built-in audio player.

4. Click on the download button if you want to download the generated audio response to your local system.
    ![generated audio response](./images/generate-audio-response.png " ")

5. Click on the *reset* button to reset all the configured input parameters to go back to default values and clear generated audio response.
    ![reset audio response](./images/reset-audio-response.png " ")

## Task 3: Changing Transcription Paramerters

To change transcription parameters, look to the <strong>Configure transcription</strong> menu to the right

1. Configure transcription

    Here you can change parameters such as Model type, Language, Speaker, Audio format, Enable Streaming and Enable SSML
        ![Configure transcription](./images/configure-transcription.png " ")

    <strong>Model type:</strong> Use this parameter to specify the model type required. Currently we offer two model types "TTS-Standard" and "TTS-Natural". Based on the model type selected, the options for speaker will change.

    <strong>Language:</strong> Use this parameter to specify the language for the input language and desired audio language. Currently we only have support for English language.

    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Use this parameter to select the desired speaker from the dropdown menu.

    <strong>Audio format:</strong> Use this parameter to select the desired audio Format from the dropdown menu.

    <strong>Enable Streaming:</strong> Use this parameter to enable streaming option to generate responses quicker for bigger input in a streaming manner for bigger input texts.

    <strong>Enable SSML:</strong> Use this parameter to get more custtomized audio responses. After toggling this button you should be able to see new dialog box *SSML examples* which has example inputs for different tags

## Task 4: Audio Format as JSON

When you choose audio format as JSON, you can also generate transcriptions with word and sentence timestamps along with the audio response.

1. Select audio format as JSON from the "Audio format" dropdown.

2. As we select the JSON audi format from the dropdown, It will open new dropdown in right-side menu "Speech Mark Types". Select from the mark types "Word" and "Sentence" as per requirement from the dropdown.

3. Click *Generate* button to generate the audio and the speech mark types json value.
    ![Configure JSON audio format](./images/configure-json-format.png " ")

4. Below the audio player you can see the speech mark types transcriptions by clicking the toggle button "Show JSON"
    ![Show JSON toggle button](./images/show-json-toggle.png " ")

5. Hide the JSON response by clicking the button "Hide JSON". Also you can copy the JSON response to clipboard by clicking the toggle button.
    ![Hide JSON toggle button](./images/hide-json-toggle.png " ")


## Task 5: Enabling SSML

Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is an XML-based markup language for speech synthesis applications. SSML allows the users to add more customization support for the users

1. Enable SSML by clicking the "Enable SSMl" toggle button.

2. This will open a new dropdown "SSML Examples"
    ![Enable SSML toggle button](./images/ssml-toggle-button.png " ")

3. Upon selecting an tag from the dropdown menu, he input text box will be filled with an example using that specific tag.
    ![SSML Examples](./images/ssml-examples.png " ")

    <strong>Sub Tag:</strong> Allows you to specify a substitution for a word or phrase or abbreviation as per requirement.

    <strong>Paragraph and Sentence Tag:</strong> Wraps a single sentence or a paragraph, helping the speech synthesizer to determine the correct break between sentences and paragraphs.

    <strong>Say As Tag:</strong> Specifies how a text should be interpreted and pronounced, such as reading numbers as digits, dates, units, currencies, telephone numbers or abbreviations.

    <strong>Break Tag:</strong> Inserts a pause of a specified duration or strength between words or sentences, providing better control over the flow of speech.

    <strong>Phoneme Tag:</strong> Provides phonetic pronunciation for words or phrases, allowing you to specify how the text should be pronounced using a phonetic alphabet like IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet).

    <strong>Prosody Tag:</strong> Controls the pitch, rate, and volume of the spoken text to adjust how it is delivered.

    <strong>Voice Tag:</strong> Allows you to use multiple voices in a single SSML request.

4. Click *Generate* button to generate the audio response for the ssml input
    ![SSML audio response](./images/ssml-output.png " ")

## Task 6: generate audio with TTS using SDK

Please follow the steps in the order described.
Before you go any further, make sure you have API signing key and config setup done, To do the setup please follow instructions in Lab#4 Task 1. Also make sure you have Python 3.x installed and that it’s available from your command line. You can check this by simply running:
```
<copy>python --version</copy>
```
If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from [python.org ](https://www.python.org)

Additionally, you’ll need to make sure you have pip available. You can check this by running:
```
<copy>pip --version</copy>
```
If you installed Python from source, with an installer from python.org, or via Homebrew, you should already have pip. If you’re on Linux and installed using your OS package manager, you may have to install pip separately.

1. Create virtualenv

    To create a virtual environment, run the venv module as a script as shown below
    ```
    <copy>python3 -m venv <name of virtual environment></copy>
    ```

2. Activate virtualenv

    Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.
    Mac OS / Linux:
    ```
    <copy>source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate</copy>
    ```
    Windows:
    ```
    <copy><name of virtual environment>\Scripts\activate</copy>
    ```

3. Install OCI

    Now, install oci running:
    ```
    <copy> pip install oci</copy>
    ```

4. OCI Speech TTS example code

Follow the steps below to run the Python SDK:

5. Download Python Code.

    Download [this](./files/tts-example.py) code file and save it your directory.

6. Execute the Code.

    Navigate to the directory where you saved the above file (by default, it should be in the 'Downloads' folder) using your terminal and execute the file by running:
    ```
    <copy>python tts-example.py</copy>
    ```
7. Running the above python example will save the audio in your local directory with default output format as *tts.mp3*.
