# Lab 2: Access OCI speech with OCI SDKs

## Introduction 

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a number of Software Development Kits (SDKs) to facilitate development of custom solutions. SDKs allow you to build and deploy apps that integrate with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Each SDK also includes tools and artifacts you need to develop an app, such as code samples and documentation. In addition, if you want to contribute to the development of the SDKs, they are all open source and available on GitHub.
 
You can invoke OCI speech capabilities through the OCI SDKs. In this lab session, we will show several code snippets to access OCI speech through the OCI SDKs. You do not need to execute the snippets, but review them to understand what information and steps are needed to implement your own integration.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 10 minutes

### Objectives:

* Learn how to use speech SDKs to communicate with our speech service endpoints.

Prerequisites:
* Have completed Lab #1 policy setup
* Familiar with Python programming is required
* Install with Python libraries: `oci` and `requests`


## **Task 1:** Setup API Signing Key and Config File
**Prerequisite: Before you generate a key pair, create the .oci directory in your home directory to store the credentials.**

Mac OS / Linux:

```
<copy>mkdir ~/.oci</copy>
```
Windows:
```
<copy>mkdir %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.oci</copy>
```

Generate an API signing key pair

1. Open User Settings

    Open the Profile menu (User menu icon) and click User Settings.
        ![User profile window](./images/user-profile-icon.png " ")

2. Open API Key

    Navigate to API Key and then Click Add API Key.
        ![User settings page and API keys button](./images/add-api-button.png " ")

3. Generate API Key

    In the dialog, select "Generate API Key Pair." Click "Download Private Key" and save the key to your .oci directory. Finally, click "Add."
        ![Generate API key window](./images/gen-api.png " ")

4. Generate Config File

    Copy the values shown on the console.
        ![Config file preview](./images/config-preview.png " ")

    Create a config file in the .oci folder and paste the values copied.
    Replace the key_file value with the path of your generated API Key.
        ![confile file preview from local setup](./images/config-local.png " ")

## **Task 2:** Prerequisites and Setup for Python

Please follow the steps in the order described.
Before you go any further, make sure you have Python 3.x installed and that it’s available from your command line. You can check this by simply running:
```
<copy>python --version</copy>
```
If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from [python.org ](https://www.python.org)

Additionally, you’ll need to make sure you have pip available. You can check this by running:
```
<copy>pip --version</copy>
```
If you installed Python from source, with an installer from python.org, or via Homebrew, you should already have pip. If you’re on Linux and installed using your OS package manager, you may have to install pip separately.


1. Create virtualenv

    To create a virtual environment, run the venv module as a script as shown below
    ```
    <copy>python3 -m venv <name of virtual environment></copy>
    ```
2. Activate virtualenv

    Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

    Mac OS / Linux:
    ```
    <copy>source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate</copy>
    ```
    Windows:
    ```
    <copy><name of virtual environment>\Scripts\activate</copy>
    ```
3. Install OCI

    Now, install oci by running:
    ```
    <copy>pip install oci</copy>
    ```

## **Task 3:** OCI Speech Service SDK Code Sample

#### Python Code
```Python
