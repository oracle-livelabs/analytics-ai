# OCI Speech

## Introduction

OCI Speech enables developers to extract text from audio using production ready pre-trained ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models. OCIâ€™s Speech service provides automated, accurate transcription at scale, without requiring any machine learning expertise. It can be accessed through REST APIs and SDKs. OCI Speech supports transcription in English (AU, GB, IN, US), French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 1 hour

### Objectives:

* Understand a high level overview of the OCI Speech
* Understand the full cycle/workflow of services provided by OCI Speech
* Learn to use REST API to interact with OCI Speech
* Learn to use CLI to interact with OCI Speech
* Learn to use the OCI Speech SDKs.
* Learn to access OCI Speech in DataScience NotebookSession
<!-- * Learn to access OCI Language Service in Data Flow. -->

### Prerequisites:

* An Oracle Free Tier, or Paid Cloud Account
* Additional prerequisites (cloud services) are mentioned per lab
* Familiar with OCI Policy and SDK/CLI setup.
* Familiar with Python/Java programming for SDK usage is strongly recommended.
* Familiar with OCI services like DataScience, DataFlow etc., are recommended, but not required.
* Familiar with editing tools (vim, nano) or shell environments (cmd, bash, etc) (Optional for API integration)

>**Note:** If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires, your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available.
