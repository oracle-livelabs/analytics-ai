# Introduction to OCI Document Understanding

## Introduction

OCI Document Understanding is a serverless, multi-tenant service, accessible using the Console, REST APIs, SDK, or CLI.

Enterprise document data has significant value related to core business activities and their customers. To gain business and customer insights effectively and at scale from this data, document analysis capabilities are needed. Some core capabilities include classifying documents, detecting text and extracting table information from the data. Building these machine learning algorithms from scratch requires extensive time, data, and data science expertise. 

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Document Understanding is an AI service that enables developers to extract text, tables, and other key data from document files through APIs and command line interface tools. With OCI Document Understanding, you can automate tedious business processing tasks with prebuilt AI models and customize document extraction to fit your industry-specific needs.
