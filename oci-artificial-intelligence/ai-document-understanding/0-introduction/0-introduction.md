# Introduction to OCI Document Understanding

## About This Workshop

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Document Understanding is a serverless, multi-tenant service, accessible using the Console, REST APIs, SDK, or CLI.

Enterprise document data has significant value related to core business activities and their customers. To gain business and customer insights effectively and at scale from this data, document analysis capabilities are needed. Some core capabilities include classifying documents, extracting text, extracting table information, and extracting key-value pairs from documents. Building these machine learning algorithms from scratch requires extensive time, data, and data science expertise, but OCI Document Understanding gives organizations ready access to these models and capabilities. 

OCI Document Understanding is an AI service that enables developers to extract text, tables, and other valuable data from document files through APIs and command line interface tools. With OCI Document Understanding, you can automate tedious business processing tasks with prebuilt AI models and customize document extraction to fit your industry-specific needs.

*Estimated Workshop Time*: 90 minutes


### Objectives
This workshop provides an introduction to the capabilities of OCI Document Understanding for both the business user and the developer. Business users can setup an OCI tenancy to use Document Understanding (Lab 1) and then try out the features on different documents using the OCI console (Lab 2). Developers can continue with the remaining labs to exercise the REST API using Postman (Lab 3) and execute a Python script that extracts key-value pairs from an invoice (Lab 4).

### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Paid Cloud Account or Trial Account with Credits
* Ability to install Postman on your local computer (for Lab 3)
