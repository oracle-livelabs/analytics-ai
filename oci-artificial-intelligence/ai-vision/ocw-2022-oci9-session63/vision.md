# Leverage Deep Learning Based Image Analysis at Scale

## Introduction 

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vision is an AI service for performing deep-learning-based image analysis at scale, that is accessible using the OCI Console, REST APIs, SDKs and CLI. Vision service features are thematically split between Document AI for document-centric images and Image Analysis for object and scene-based images. 

With pre-built models available out of the box, developers can easily build image recognition and text recognition into their applications without machine learning (ML) expertise.  For industry -specific use cases, developers can automatically train custom vision models using their own data. 

In this session, we will walk through the OCI console to familiarize ourselves with the Vision service. We’ll discuss the data requirements and formats, and show you how to upload to Oracle Object storage for later to train our models. 


***Estimated Time***: 2 hours

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Understand the data requirements and data formats for analyzing images using OCI Vision
- Upload data into OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) Object Storage
- Get familiar with the OCI console and be able to demo key OCI Vision features  


### Pre-requisites 

-	A free tier or paid tenancy in OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)
-	Familiarity with OCI Object Storage is desirable, but not required


## Policy Setup

Before you start using OCI Vision, your tenancy administrator should set up the following policies by following below steps:

- Navigate to Policies

    - Log into OCI Cloud Console. Using the Burger Menu on the top left corner, navigate to Identity & Security and click it, and then select Policies item under Identity.

      ![Navigate to Policy Section](images/policy1.png " ")

- Click Create Policy 

   ![Create Policy](images/policy2.png " ")

Create a new policy with the following statements:

  - If you want to allow all the users in your tenancy to use vision service, create a new policy with the below statement     

```
<copy> 
allow any-user to use ai-service-vision-family in tenancy 
</copy>
```

  ![Setup policy for tenancy](images/policy3.png " ")

  - If you want to limit access to a user group, create a new policy with the below statement

```
<copy> 
allow group <group-name> to use ai-service-vision-family in tenancy 
</copy>
```

  ![Setup policy for users](images/policy4.png " ")

## Task 1: Understand the data requirements for OCI AI Vision service

The purpose of **Task 1** is to understand what file types you can use to leverage the Vision service. The vision service works with multiple formats of image data in order to detect objects, assign labels to images, extract text, and more. The service accepts data through Object Storage and locally stored images (if using via OCI console).

The service offers sync and async APIs to analyze images, with data requirements for each detailed below:

| API | Description | Supported Input Format |
| -------- |:-------:| -----:|
| sync API (analyzeImage, analyzeDocument) | Analyzes individual images |<p>* JPG, PNG, (PDF and Tiff for analyzeDocument) <br>*Up to 8 MB<br> *Single image input<br></p>|
| async API/jobs/startImageAnalysisjob/jobs/start | Analyze multiple images or multi-page PDFs | <p>* JPG, PNG (PDF and Tiff for analyzeDocument)<br>* Up to 2000 images input<br> * Supports multi-page PDF<br></p>| 


## Task 2: Upload Data to Object Storage 

1. Create an Object Storage Bucket

  - First, From the OCI Services menu, click 'Object Storage'.

    ![Navigate to Object Storage](images/cloud-storage-bucket.png " ")

  - Then, Select Compartment from the left dropdown menu. Choose the compartment matching your name or company name. If you are the **only** user of the tenancy, you can use the Root compartment for purposes of this lab.

    ![Select Compartment](images/compartment.png " ")

  - Next click 'Create Bucket'

    ![Create bucket](images/bucket.png " ")

  - Next, fill out the dialog box:

    * Bucket Name: Provide a name
    * Storage Tier: STANDARD

  - Then click 'Create'

      ![Labeled Dataset](images/labeled-dataset-list.png " ")

## Task 5: Create a Project

A project is a way to organize multiple models in the same workspace. It is the first step to start.

1. Log into OCI Cloud Console. Using the Burger Menu on the top left corner, navigate to Analytics and AI menu and click it, and then select Vision Service item under AI services. Clicking the Vision Service Option will navigate one to the Vision Service Console. Once here, select Projects under "Custom Models" header on the left hand side of the console.

      ![Custom model](images/project.png " ")

2. The Create Project button navigates User to a form where they can specify the compartment in which to create a Vision Project. The project we create here is named "CareClinicsDemo".

      ![Create a Project](images/create-project.png " ")

3. Once the details are entered click the Create Button. If the project is successfully created it will show up in projects pane.


## Task 6: Select Model Type

1. Drill into the project that you just created. Next, we will create a model. 

2. You will need to select 'Create Model' within your project. 

      ![Create Model](images/create-model.png " ")

3. AI Vision Service supports training of an on-demand custom model for Object Detection, Image Classification, and Document Image Classification features. We will select **image classification** out of the three options in the drop down.
       ![Choose Model](images/select-model.png " ")


## Task 7: Select Training Data 

1. To train a custom model, you will need training data. There are two main options depending on if you already have an annotated dataset, or only have raw (unlabeled) images.

      ![Two options for training data](images/model-type.png " ")


2. Choose Existing Dataset

  - Recall that in **Task 4**, we created a dataset that will now be leveraged in the training model. 

  - Choose existing dataset: If you have an existing annotated dataset, you can select it by clicking "Choose Existing Dataset." If you've previously annotated images using OCI Data Labeling service, select that button and select the dataset file of your choice. If you have annotated your images using some 3rd party tool, you can upload that dataset file to object storage and select via the "object storage" button.

    ![Choose Existing Dataset](images/dataset.png " ")


    ![Training Data](images/training-data.png " ")

#### If you would like to learn more about Adding and Editing labels in the future, you can find more information by reviewing documentation here [Adding and Editing Labels](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-labeling/data-labeling/using/labels.htm).

## Task 8: Train your Custom Model and Submit

1. In the "train model" step, you will name your model, add a description of it, and optionally, specify a training duration.

    ![Training Duration](images/train-model1.png " ")

2. In the "review" step, you can verify that all of your information is correct and go back if you want to make adjustments (on training time, for example). When you want to start training, click "submit" and this will kick of the process. You can then check on the status of your model in the project where you created it.
    ![Review and Submit](images/review.png " ")

## Task 9: Test the Model on New Images

1. Navigate to the Project Details page and click on the model just created.

    ![Test Model](images/project-model.png " ")

2. Click the [link](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/HTMmO7ndSl_UUwuJu2dKfWu4l5DsaYjZRqutq90atlQQIq6gtPRue5xWeGMYDGtb/n/orasenatdpltintegration03/b/CareClinics-bucket/o/test-images.zip) to download sample test images to your local machine. 

3. Upload one image from the test dataset on your local machine to test the newly created model.

  - Select 'Local file' under 'Image source'

  - Select 'select one…' in the 'Upload image' section. Navigate to the folder containing the test images on your local machine and select an image to upload.

    ![Analyze images](images/model-results.png " ")

  - Examine confidence measurements under the 'Results' pane. You can see our Vision model correctly predicted this image as an insurance card. You can test out with other images as well. 

    ![Analyze results](images/analyze-results.png " ")
