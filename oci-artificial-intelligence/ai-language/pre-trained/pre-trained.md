## Task 2: Analyze Text with Python SDK

### 1. **About OCI SDK**

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a number of Software Development Kits (SDKs) to facilitate development of custom solutions. SDKs allow you to build and deploy apps that integrate with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Each SDK also includes tools and artifacts you need to develop an app, such as code samples and documentation. In addition, if you want to contribute to the development of the SDKs, they are all open source and available on GitHub.

You can invoke OCI Language capabilities through the OCI SDKs. This section will show several code snippets to access OCI Language through the OCI SDKs. You do not need to execute the snippets, but review them to understand what information and steps are needed to implement your own integration. In addition, you can find OCI Language samples in different programming languages in this [github repository](https://github.com/oracle/oci-data-science-ai-samples/tree/master/ai_services/language)
