# Get Started

## Introduction

Before you get started, you will need an Oracle Cloud account. This 5-minute lab walks you through the steps of getting an Oracle Cloud Free Tier account and signing in.

### Existing Cloud Accounts

If you already have access to an Oracle Cloud account, including an Oracle Cloud account using [Oracle Universal Credits](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/universal-credits.html), skip to **STEP 2** to sign in to your cloud tenancy.

### Two Cloud Offers in One

Oracle Cloud Free Tier allows you to sign up for an Oracle Cloud account which provides a number of Always Free services and a Free Trial with US$300 of free credit to use on all eligible Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services for up to 30 days. The Always Free services are available for an unlimited period of time. The Free Trial services may be used until your US$300 of free credits are consumed or the 30 days has expired, whichever comes first.

13. Your account is provisioning and should be available soon! You might want to log out as you wait for your account to be provisioned. You'll receive two emails from Oracle. One email will be the initial notification that provisioning is underway. The other email will be notification that provisioning is complete. Here is a copy of the final notification:

## Task 2: Sign in to Your Account

1. Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com). Enter your Cloud Account Name and click **Next**. This is the name you chose while creating your account in the previous section. It's NOT your email address. If you've forgotten the name, see the confirmation email.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/labs/cloud-login/images/cloud-oracle.png " ")

2. Click **Continue** to sign in using the *"oraclecloudidentityservice"*.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/labs/cloud-login/images/cloud-login-tenant-single-sigon.png " ")

   When you sign up for an Oracle Cloud account, a user is created for you in Oracle Identity Cloud Service with the username and password you selected at sign up. You can use this single sign-on option to sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and then navigate to other Oracle Cloud services without reauthenticating. This user has administrator privileges for all the Oracle Cloud services included with your account.

3. Enter your Cloud Account credentials and click **Sign In**. Your username is your email address. The password is what you chose when you signed up for an account.

4. You are now signed in to Oracle Cloud!
