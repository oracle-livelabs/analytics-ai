# Expose Digital Assistant Skill as Visual Builder Application

## Introduction

Exposing an Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA) skill as a Visual Builder Application enhances the user experience and extends functionality. With Visual Builder, create a rich, interactive interface, providing an engaging way to interact with your skill. 

Design a custom UI, incorporating visual elements and dynamic content for a more intuitive and natural user experience. Exposing your skill as a Visual Builder Application also offers cross-channel accessibility, making it accessible as a web application and conversational interface. 

Integrating your ODA skill with Visual Builder allows users to interact seemlessly with OAC charts by leveraging the Oracle Web SDK.

Estimated Lab Time: 1 hour 

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create a new VB Application to host your ODA Skill
* Allow Users to interact with your skill
* Enable UI Customization for your users

3. Open the application and navigate to web apps > atom > main > main-embedded-chat > Javascript

    ![Edit Javascript](images/vb-edit-javascript.png)

4. Input your ODA instance URI and channel id from Task 1 Step 4 in the respective tags 

5. Open the VB app in preview and check if the application is working as expected
