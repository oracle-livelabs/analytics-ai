# Expose Visual Builder Application as Webview in ODA

## Introduction

In this technical lab, you will learn how to create a web view in ODA (Oracle Digital Assistant) by linking an Oracle Function to an API Gateway and exposing the API Gateway endpoint as a web interface. 

The first step is to develop an Oracle Function which points to your VB application created in the previous lab, then set up an API Gateway within your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console. This involves creating a new gateway, configuring routes, and setting up policies to control access and handle requests. You will link this API Gateway to your Oracle Function by specifying the appropriate endpoint and methods. 

Once the API Gateway and Oracle Function are connected, you can expose the API Gateway endpoint as your web view. This step involves configuring the necessary settings in API Gateway to make the endpoint accessible to users. 

By following this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in integrating Oracle Functions with API Gateway to create a seamless and secure web interface for your ODA application. This approach not only enhances the user experience but also provides a scalable and manageable solution for exposing backend functions to end-users. 

Estimated Lab Time: 2 hours

## Task 2: Create and Deploy a Function as an Intermediary Server 

In this section, we will delve into the process of creating and deploying an Oracle Function. OCI Functions provide a serverless environment, allowing you to focus on your code without worrying about server management. We will guide you through the steps of developing and deploying an OCI Function, which can be a powerful tool for extending your application's capabilities. You will learn how to create a function, configure its settings, and deploy it using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console or command-line interface. By the end of this section, you will be ready to connect the function to the API Gateway.

1. Download the sample function

    [fn-oac-oda.zip](https://idb6enfdcxbl.objectstorage.us-chicago-1.oci.customer-oci.com/n/idb6enfdcxbl/b/Excel-Chicago/o/Livelabs%2Foac-vb-charts%2Ffn-oda-oac-livelab.zip)

2. Extract the contents and replace the url with the url of your live vb application created in the previous lab 

  ![Replace Live Url](images/fn-config.png)

  Note: Make sure to save your file when making changes in your IDE

3. Navigate back to your function application created in Task 1 step 3

4. Select Getting Started > Local setup

    ![Fn Local Setup](images/fn-local-setup.png)

    - This will give you your specific instructions for: 
        - Setting the context
        - Logging in to the container registry 
        - Deploying the function to your application

   > **Note:** Since we imported the example function file, you don't need to initialize a new fn. Instead, start at step 3. Also make sure to switch into the function directory and/or run the commands from VS code console before running the fn commands.
   

## Task 3: Add your Function as a Route on API Gateway

1. Navigate back to the API Gateway you created in Task 1 Step 4

2. Navigate to 'Deployments' and create a new deployment

    ![API Gateway Edit](images/fn-api-gw-create-deployment.png)

3. Give your deployment a name and in the CORS section add the following:
    - Allowed Origins: *
    - Allowed headers: Content-Type: application/json
    - Allowed methods: POST 

    ![API GW Deployment](images/fn-api-gw-basic-info.png)

   > **Note:** you can restrict allowed origins if you'd like; this is for demo purposes only.

4. Select 'Next'

5. Keep 'No Auth', select 'Next'

    ![No Auth](images/fn-api-gw-no-auth.png)

6. Create a new route as post and connect your deployed function as the backend 

    ![Gateway Route](images/fn-api-gw-route.png)

    > **Note:** the route name you give will be needed later to configure the Webview

    - Expand 'Show route request policies and add the following 

    ![Route Policy](images/fn-api-gw-request-policy.png)

7. Select 'Next', review the changes then click 'Create'

8. Select the deployment and take note of the endpoint. Append the route name you used in Task 3 Step 6.

> **Note:** Once provisioned, take note of the base web url. This will be used in later labs. 

## Task 5: Dynamic Group & Policy creation for Oracle Digital Assistant

This task will help you to create desired dynamic group & necessary policy for the Oracle Digital Assistant

1. Attach the policy at the root compartment level. Please change the values of OCIDs to your own values here.

    Add policies for managing OAC, VB, API Gateway, Functions
    - Go to Identity & Security > Identity > Policies
    - Create new policy
    - Add the following rules 

    ```text
    <copy>
    ALLOW any-user to use functions-family in compartment <compartment-name> where ALL {request.principal.type= 'ApiGateway', request.resource.compartment.id = '<compartment-id>'}
    </copy>

    # Full manage permissions for OAC (Create, View, Update, Delete, Scale, Start, Stop...)
    <copy>
    allow group <group> to manage analytics-instances in tenancy
    allow group <group> to manage analytics-instance-work-requests in tenancy
    </copy>

    # Full manage permissions for Visual Builder
    <copy>
    allow group <admin_group> to manage visualbuilder-instance in compartment  <compartmentId>
    </copy>

    # Access for Dynamic Group 
    <copy>
    Allow dynamic-group <dynamic-oda-group> to use fn-invocation in tenancy
    </copy>
    ```

    > **Note:**
    > * Please make sure that the compartmentId should be the one under which the resource is  created.
