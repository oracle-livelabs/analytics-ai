# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Emotions run high with Oracle Red Bull Racing. Determining how fans feel is key to successfully understanding the passion and excitement of the race, and then applying those sentiments for new business drivers.
Through a variety of OCI AI Services, which provide prebuilt and custom trainable AI models, this analysis becomes possible even without data science experience. In this workshop we will discover how to understand insights in Twitter conversations, and extract text from meme images. We'll analyze the data to get a complete picture of the emotions during an Oracle Red Bull race, and discover how to apply sentiment understanding to uncover more valuable insights for your organization.
