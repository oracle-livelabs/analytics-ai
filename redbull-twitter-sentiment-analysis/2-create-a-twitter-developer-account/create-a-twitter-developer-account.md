# Create a Twitter Developer Account

## Introduction

This workshop uses Twitter's [Filtered Stream API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/introduction) for retrieving public tweets in near real-time. To use this API, we need access to a Twitter developer account.

### Objectives

1. Create and/or login to a Twitter user account.
2. Create and/or login to a Twitter developer account.
3. Create a Twitter App and generate access keys.

### Prerequisites

You will have to create both a Twitter user account (in case you do not have one already) and a Twitter developer account (again, assuming you do not have one). The creation and usage of these accounts are governed by the following terms of service agreements:

1. [Terms of Service](https://twitter.com/en/tos)
2. [Developer Agreement and Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy)

Please make sure you can abide by the terms and conditions mentioned in these agreements.

> **Note:** If creating a Twitter account or a Twitter developer account will not work for you, this demo includes a pseudo tweets generator that can be used to simulate the responses retrieved using the Twitter API. If you decide to go that route, you can skip the rest of this lab and ignore the instructions relating to the Twitter `Bearer Token`. Look for information about the tweets generated as part of the last lab in this workshop.

## Task 1: Create and/or login to your Twitter user account

In the first step, we'll make sure you have a valid Twitter user account. If you already have a functioning Twitter account (one that you can login to), please skip to the next task.

Please follow the Twitter sign-up process [here](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup).

## Task 2: Create and/or login to your Twitter developer account

1. After you have created your Twitter user account and successfully logged-in to Twitter using this account, please follow the instructions [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).

2. You will need to validate your email account to complete the registration process.

## Task 3: Creating a Twitter app

1. After verifying your email account, you will be asked to name your first app. This value can be changed later so choose a name that will work for now. The app name must be unique.

2. You will be presented with a set of keys:
   * API Key
   * API Key Secret
   * Bearer Token

   **Please save these keys in a safe place as we will need them later**.  
   The Bearer token will be used in this demo to authenticate with the Twitter API.

3. After you have copied and saved your keys in a safe place, you can proceed to the Developer Portal Dashboard where you will see summary information for your Developer Account.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
