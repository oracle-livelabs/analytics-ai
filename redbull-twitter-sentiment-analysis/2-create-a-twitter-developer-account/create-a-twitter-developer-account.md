# Create a Twitter Developer Account

## Introduction

This workshop makes extensive use of Twitter's [Filtered Steam API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/introduction) for retrieving public tweets in near real-time. In order to use this API, we need to have a Twitter developer account.

### Objectives

1. Create and/or login to a Twitter user account.
2. Create and/or login to a Twitter developer account.
3. Create a Twitter App and generate access keys.

### Prerequisites

You will have to create both a Twitter user account (in case you do not have one already) and a Twitter developer account (again, assuming you do not have one). The creation and usage of those accounts are governed by the following terms of service agreements:

1. [Terms of Service](https://twitter.com/en/tos)
2. [Developer Agreement and Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy)

Please make sure you are able to abide by the terms and conditions mentioned in these agreements.

## Task 1: Create and/or login to your Twitter user account

In the first step, we will need to make sure you have a valid Twitter user account. If you do already have a functioning Twitter account (one that you can login to), please skip to the next task.

Please follow the Twitter sign-up process [here](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup).

## Task 2: Create and/or login to your Twitter developer account

1. After you have created your Twitter user account and successfully logged-in to Twitter using this account, please follow the instructions [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).

2. You will need to validate your email account to complete the registration process.

## Task 3: Create your first app

1. After verifying your email account, you will be asked to name your first app. This value can be changed later so choose a name that will work for now. The app name must be unique.
2. You will be presented with a set of keys:
   * API Key
   * API Key Secret
   * Bearer Token

   Please save these keys in a safe place. We will need them later.
	 The Bearer token will be used in this demo to authenticate with the Twitter API.
3. After your have copied and saved your keys in a safe place, you can proceed to the Developer Portal Dashboard where you will see summary information for your Developer Account.
