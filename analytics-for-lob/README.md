### Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how lines of business (LOB) can utilize Oracle Fusion ERP Analytics and Oracle Essbase to benefit their business through advanced data management and analytics.

Lines of business are under enormous pressure to generate more insights, faster, from their financial systems and other critical data sources. But for most organizations, far too much time is spent manually sourcing, managing, preparing, and securing data – leaving far too little time for true analysis and insight.

Oracle Fusion ERP Analytics provides the fastest path to insight with your ERP data, based on its pre-built integration to your ERP Cloud, pre-built data model, and pre-built interfaces – including KPIs, dashboards, and self- service project areas that you can use to easily customize and extend your analysis. And, it’s all built on the foundation of Oracle Analytics Cloud and the self-tuning, self-scaling, self-securing Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse.

Oracle Essbase is the market leading online analytical processing (OLAP) server for enterprise performance management (EPM) applications.  With Oracle Essbase, business users can perform a variety of analyses such as forecasting, root cause identification, scenario planning, variance analysis, and what-if modeling while integrating with multiple data sources. These analyses can be delivered through various reporting options, with fast and easy development, deployment, and maintenance. Oracle Essbase not only provides scalability, robust security, and rapid-response, but most importantly it brings advanced analytics to business users to enable a deeper understanding of the business, driving improved business results.

This workshop is designed to give you a hands-on experience with various components of Oracle Essbase as well as both the pre-built and self-service facets of Oracle Fusion ERP Analytics.
