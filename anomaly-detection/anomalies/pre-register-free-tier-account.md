# Getting Started

## Introduction

Before you get started, you will need an Oracle Cloud account.

### Existing Cloud Accounts

If you already have access to an Oracle Cloud account, including an Oracle Cloud account through [Oracle Universal Credits](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/universal-credits.html),  **STEP 1** can be used to sign in to tenancy.


## Task 1: Sign in to Your Account

If you've signed out of the Oracle Cloud, use these steps to sign back in.

1. Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com) and Enter your Cloud Account Name and click **Next**. This is the name you chose while creating your account in the previous section. It's NOT your email address. If you've forgotten the name, see the confirmation email.

2. Expand the arrow after *"Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Direct Sign-In"* to reveal the login input fields.

3. Enter your Cloud Account credentials and click **Sign In**. Your username is your email address. The password is what you chose when you signed up for an account.
