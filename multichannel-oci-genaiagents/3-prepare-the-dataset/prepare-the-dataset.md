# Prepare the dataset

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through how to upload data to be ingested and indexed by the OCI Generative AI Agents service.
The dataset is the fuel for the service. After the data has been indexed, you will be able to ask complex questions about it and have the service answer those questions like a human would.
In this lab, you will be using a dataset we have created for you which contains parts of the OCI Generative AI service documentation. This will allow the Agent to answer user questions about the service.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a storage bucket to store the dataset.
* Upload the dataset to the storage bucket.
