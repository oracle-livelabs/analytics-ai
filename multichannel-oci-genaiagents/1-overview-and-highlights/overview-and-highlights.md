# Introduction

Companies around the world rely on standardised communication platforms for running their business - inside and outside of the organization. From raising expenses and IT support tickets through Slack, to selling insurance policies or transportation tickets through WhatsApp, all around the world, AI is coming closer to users by way of familiar communication channels. 
Workshop Description: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI Agents combines the power of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with your enterprise data, letting users query diverse enterprise knowledge bases. Coming soon, the service will provide users with up-to-date information through a natural language interface and the ability to act directly on it. See how Oracle supports the quick implementation of secure enterprise RAG, using your organization’s data, with seamless access through various channels, like Slack, Teams, WhatsApp and others.
