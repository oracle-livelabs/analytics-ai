# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is the hands-on portion of the "Creating Better Data Visualizations with Oracle Analytics" session hosted by the Oracle Analytics Technical Enablement team. To convey the right message in data visualizations, we must know how to pick the correct visualization type, otherwise, the chart types we select may contradict with our message.

In this workshop, we explore different ways to visualize time comparison and geographical relationships in Oracle Analytics Cloud.

Estimated Workshop Time: 25 minutes
