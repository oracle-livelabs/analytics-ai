# Perform the mapping

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through the process of leveraging generative AI models to perform mapping of radiology protocol names to a standardized lexicon.

Estimated Time: 40 minutes

### Objectives

This lab focuses on the use of generative AI to perform mapping of non-standardized radiology procedure names to standardized names.  This will involve:

1. Synthetic data that represents a "lexicon" or collection of standardized radiology imaging procedure names for Computed Tomography (CT) exams.
1. Synthetic data containing examples of how imaging facilities may refer to these procedure types, with common variants including spelling, word orders, abbreviations, anatomical names, special characters, etc.
1. Creating "prompts" for the AI model.  Prompts are text-based instructions given to an AI model to produce specific content. A prompt may contain:
    * A clear task or question
    * Context or background information
    * Specific requirements or constraints
    * Examples or formatting guidelines
    * Style or tone directions

In this lab you will:

* Provide an AI model with a prompt containing the relevant data and instructions to process it
* Receive and evaluate a response from the model.
* Provide your own variant to be mapped or evaluated.
* Further test the model using variants that are in another language.
* Explore the performance of other models.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud account
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Perform your first mapping

1. Copy and paste the following prompt into the chat message window, then press **Submit** .  Notice the components of the prompt we are providing:  instructions, standard data terms, and terms to be mapped.  Also included is a field *RAND\_ID* which matches with *CODE* for the lexicon term *LONG\_COMMON\_NAME*.  This is used in the prompt to help us calculate how well the model performed its matching task.  

    >**//INSTRUCTIONS//**  
    >For these radiology procedure names, Return a table of row #,STUDY\_DESCRIPTION, best semantically matching LONG\_COMMON\_NAME (blank if no match), and CONFIDENCE (low, medium, high) of the match, CODE, RAND\_ID,  whether RAND\_ID equals CODE.  Also give the # of processed STUDY\_DESCRIPTIONs and # of LONG\_COMMON\_NAMEs, and # of matches.

## Task 2: Analyze the results

1. Verify from response of the model that 50 STUDY\_DESCRIPTIONS were processed.
1. Review the matches and see if the matches make sense.  RAND\_ID and CODE must be equal for a successful match.
1. Identify if any STUDY\_DESCRIPTIONS had medium or low confidence matches to a standard term.
1. Ask the model why a particular match was more difficult.  For example, in the message area enter "Why was CT left arm w/o more difficult to match?" and hit **Submit**.  Does the response seem reasonable?

## Task 3: Test the model further

1. Ask the model to match a new study description by entering into the Chat message area: "Map MRI of the brain - Alzheimers research".  Click on **Submit**.  Does the response seem reasonable?
1. Click on **Clear Chat** in the Chat area to restart the interaction with the model.  Any former prompt information we've provided will be removed.
1. Test the model on another set of radiology procedure names with different types of variants (mispellings, abbreviations, alternative anatomy names).  Copy the following prompt into the Chat message area and press **Submit**.  Then evaluate the response.  

    >**//INSTRUCTIONS//**  
    >For these radiology procedure names, Return a table of row #,STUDY\_DESCRIPTION, best semantically matching LONG\_COMMON\_NAME (blank if no match), and CONFIDENCE (low, medium, high) of the match, CODE, RAND\_ID,  whether RAND\_ID equals CODE.

1. Ensure the model is not *cheating*, i.e., recognizing that RAND\_ID and CODE can be used to link to the appropriate LONG\_COMMON\_NAME.  To do that we will not supply RAND\_ID in the dataset.  First, click **Clear chat** in the Chat message window.  Then paste the following prompt, click **Submit** and evaluate the response.

## Task 4: Evaluate an alternative model

1. To select a new model, choose the *cohere.command-r-plus v1.2* model in the **Model** dropdownlist in Chat.  
    ![Screenshot showing how to choose the cohere.command-r-plus v1.2 model](./images/select-model-commandrplus.png)
1. In **Parameters**, adjust the maximum output tokens to 4000.  This will help ensure the model can generate a response of sufficient length.
1. Copy the following prompt into the Chat message area and press **Submit**.  Then evaluate the response.  Notice speed, output formatting, and any performance differences.
