# Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI is a fully managed service for seamlessly integrating versatile language models into a wide range of use cases, including writing assistance, summarization, analysis, and chat. 

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

## About this Workshop

You can review this PowerPoint for a general overview of the topic.
* [HOL 3468 Text Standardization with Generative AI](../1-overview-and-highlights/pdf/ocw24_hol3468%20oci%20genai%20textstandardization.pdf)

This hands-on lab introduces the use of generative AI in data standardization, with a focus on healthcare applications. Participants will:

* Learn how AI can map diverse text data to standardized terminology
* Focus on radiology imaging procedures as a practical example
* Use advanced language models like Cohere's Command R and Meta's Llama 3
* Practice mapping varied procedure names to standardized names and codes
* Work with synthetic data through interactive chat interfaces
* Gain skills to demonstrate the process and understand success factors

By the end of this lab, attendees will have practical experience applying generative AI to real-world data standardization challenges.


Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Setup the environment required to access Chat in the Generative AI service.
* Select the model(s) of interest and update relevant parameters.
* Pass the model a synthetic dataset including lexicon elements and text variants to be mapped.
* Assess the quality of the model response.
* Have a conversation with the data, providing your own text variants to map.
