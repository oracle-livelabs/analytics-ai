# Provision and Configure EBS, and Prepare All Data Sources

## Introduction

In this lab, you will provision an EBS instance and the associated networking resources. Thereafter, you will configure the EBS instance and insert data into the EBS database. You will also provision an Autonomous Database and load data into it.

Estimated Lab Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

- Provision an EBS instance on OCI from OCI Marketplace.
- Connect to the EBS instance, configure it and then load data into EBS.
- Provision an Autonomous Database to act as a data source and load data into it.

### Prerequisites

- Terminal on Unix/Linux or Putty on Windows.
- Access to the following files:
    - [etl\_audit\_tbl.sql](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/VEKec7t0mGwBkJX92Jn0nMptuXIlEpJ5XJA-A6C9PymRgY2LhKbjWqHeB5rVBbaV/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/modern-data-warehouse/etl_audit_tbl.sql)

## Task 1: Create a new security list and a public subnet in VCN

In order to keep the ODI instance and the EBS instance that we are about to provision in separate subnets, we will create a new public subnet in the virtual cloud network (VCN) that was created in Lab 1.

1. Return to the **Associated Resources** tab of the Stack to get to the VCN. In our case, the VCN is on page 2, so we navigate to page 2 and then open the VCN's page in a new tab.
