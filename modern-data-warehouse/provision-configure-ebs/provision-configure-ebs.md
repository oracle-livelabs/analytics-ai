# Provision and Configure EBS, and Prepare All Data Sources

## Introduction

In this lab, you will provision an EBS instance and the associated networking resources. Thereafter, you will configure the EBS instance and insert data into the EBS database. You will also provision an Autonomous Database and load data into it.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

- Provision an EBS instance on OCI from OCI Marketplace.
- Connect to the EBS instance, configure it and then load data into EBS.
- Provision an Autonomous Database to act as a data source and load data into it.

### Prerequisites

- Terminal on Unix/Linux or Putty on Windows.
- Access to the following files:
    - [etl\_audit\_tbl.sql](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/modern-data-warehouse/etl_audit_tbl.sql)

**Note:** Please download the files above before continuing.

## Task 1: Create a new security list and a public subnet in VCN

In order to keep the ODI instance and the EBS instance that you are about to provision in separate subnets, you will create a new public subnet in the virtual cloud network (VCN) that was created in the previous lab.

1. Return to the **Job Resources** tab of the Stack to get to the VCN. In our case, the VCN is on page 2, so we navigate to page 2 and then open the VCN's page in a new tab.

    ![Links to Associated Resources](./images/links-to-provisioned-resources.png "Links to Associated Resources")
    
    ![Navigate to VCN](./images/navigate-to-vcn.png "Navigate to VCN")
    
    ![Go to VCN](./images/go-to-vcn.png "Go to VCN")
    
2. In the **Resources** panel on the left side of the screen, click on **Security Lists** and then click on the **Create Security List** button.
    
    ![Go to Security Lists](./images/go-to-security-lists.png "Go to Security Lists")

    ```bash
    <copy>
    scp -i &lt;path_to_private_key&gt; &lt;path_to_etl_audit_tbl.sql&gt; opc@&lt;ebs_instance_public_ip&gt;:
    </copy>
    ```

2. Login to the EBS instance as the opc user using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    <copy>
    ssh -i <path_to_private_key> opc@<ebs_instance_public_ip>
    </copy>
    ```
        
3. Now, switch to the root user and move the **etl\_audit\_tbl.sql** file into the home directory of the **oracle** user and make oracle user the owner of the file. The file will be used towards the end of this lab. 

    ```bash
    <copy>    
    sudo su
        
    mv /home/opc/etl_audit_tbl.sql /home/oracle/etl_audit_tbl.sql
        
    chown oracle /home/oracle/etl_audit_tbl.sql
    </copy>
    ```
        
4. As the root user, execute the updatehosts.sh script.

    ```bash
    <copy>        
    sh /u01/install/scripts/updatehosts.sh
    </copy>
    ```
        
    ![Update Hosts](./images/update-hosts.png "Update Hosts")
    
5. Use **vi** to add the public IP address of the EBS instance against the hostname in the hosts file, as shown in the image below. The vi keyboard command to edit is **i**. After the edit, save the file by pressing **escape + :wq**. 
    
    ```bash
    <copy>
