# Create and Connect to ODI Repository

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create a master and a work repository, both of which are needed to run data integrations. After creating the work repository, you will connect to it. 

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

- Create and connect to master and work repositories in ODI. 

### Prerequisites

- ADW and ODI instance created in Lab 1.
- ADW wallet file downloaded in Lab 1.
- Access to the following file: 
    - [ModernDW\_Schema.sql](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/modern-data-warehouse/ModernDW_Schema.sql)
    
## Task 1: Create Empty Target Tables and ODI Schema in Autonomous Data Warehouse

1. Connect to the Autonomous Data Warehouse that you had created as part of the ODI-ADW-OAC stack as the ADMIN user via SQL Developer. You downloaded the wallet to the local machine in Lab 1.

2. Run the commands below to create a schema for the metadata repository. You will call this schema **ODI**. Replace **MyPassword** in the first command with a password of your choosing.
    
    ```sql
    <copy>
    create user ODI identified by MyPassword;

    grant DWROLE to ODI;

    grant unlimited tablespace to ODI;

    grant PDB_DBA to ODI; 
    </copy>
    ```  

3. Now, run the following commands to create **EBS** schema for the target tables. Replace **MyPassword** in the first command with a password of your choosing.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    create user EBS identified by MyPassword;

    grant DWROLE to EBS;

    grant unlimited tablespace to EBS;

    grant PDB_DBA to EBS;   
    </copy>
    ```  
    
4. Connect to the ADW instance, again, but this time as the EBS user and execute the **ModernDW\_Schema.sql** script to create empty target tables for our integration under the EBS schema. 
   
## Task 2: Create ODI Master Repository

In order to use ODI, you need to create a master and a work repository. For this, you are going to continue using the same Autonomous Data Warehouse.

1. Return to ODI Studio.

    ![ODI Studio Home](./images/odi-studio-home.png "ODI Studio Home")
    
2. Click on **File**, then **New**.

    ![Click on New Under File](./images/click-on-new.png "Click on New Under File")
    
3. Select **Create a New Master Repository** and press **OK**.

    ![Create Master Repository](./images/create-master-repository.png "Create Master Repository")
    
4. From the **Technology** drop down, select **Oracle**. Select the **Use Credential File** option and click on the magnifying glass icon in front of the **Credential File** field. The file should be in **/home/Oracle/Desktop**. Thereafter, choose the high connection in the **Connection Details** drop down. The JDBC URL will get auto-populated. Now, enter **ODI** as the user and provide the password for the ODI schema. The DBA User would be ADMIN. Please enter its password, as well.

    ![Connect to Database](./images/connect-to-database.png "Connect to Database")
    
5. Click on **Test Connection**. If everything was done correctly, you should see a **Successful Connection** message. If not, then please fix the error and proceed. Now, click on **Next**.

    ![Test Database Connection](./images/test-database-connection.png "Test Database Connection")
    
6. On the **Authentication** page, enter **SUPERVISOR** as the **Supervisor User**, please provide the supervisor password and confirm it. Then, hit **Next**. Click on **Finish** on the final page.

    ![Enter Supervisor Password](./images/enter-supervisor-password.png "Enter Supervisor Password")
    
    ![Create master Repository](./images/create-master-repo.png "Create master Repository")
    
7. ODI Studio will take 3-5 minutes to create the repository. Once it is done, you will see a prompt telling you that the creation was successful.

    ![Monitor Creation Progress](./images/monitor-creation-progress.png "Monitor Creation Progress")
    
    ![Confirmation of Successful Creation](./images/confirmation-of-successful-creation.png "Confirmation of Successful Creation")

## Task 3: Connect to Master Repository

1. Click on **Connect To Repository** and create a wallet password to secure the ODI and repository credentials.

    ![Connect to Master Repository](./images/connect-to-master-repo.png "Connect to Master Repository")

    ![Create Wallet Password](./images/create-wallet-password.png "Create Wallet Password")

2. Click on the pencil sign in the login prompt to edit the details of the displayed login profile. 
    
    ![Edit Master Repository Connection Details](./images/edit-master-connection-details.png "Edit Master Repository Connection Details")
    
**Note:** In case a login profile is not displayed then click on the **+** button to create a new one.

![Create Login Profile](./images/create-login-profile.png "Create Login Profile")

2. Provide a name to the login and enter **SUPERVISOR** as the user and provide the password for **SUPERVISOR**. In the Database Connection section, enter ODI as the user and provide the password to the ODI schema. From the driver list drop down, select **Oracle JDBC Driver** and select the **Use Credential File** check box. As done previously, select the ADW wallet in the credential file selector and choose the high connection. 

    ![Update Connection Details](./images/edit-master-repo-connection-info.png "Update Connection Details")
    
3. Test the connection and make sure that it is successful, fixing any errors encountered along the way.

    ![Test Connection to Master Repository](./images/test-connection-to-master-repository.png "Test Connection to Master Repository")

4. Now, select the **Login Name** that you just created. Enter **SUPERVISOR** in the user field and enter the password. Click on **OK**. You may be prompted to enter the ADW wallet's password. If so, then provide the password, click **OK** and you will find yourself logged into the Master Repository.

    ![Login to Master Repository](./images/login-to-master-repo.png "Login to Master Repository")
    
    ![Enter Wallet Password](./images/enter-wallet-password-to-access-credentials.png "Enter Wallet Password")
    
## Task 4: Create a Work Repository

1. Click on the **Topology** tab. Expand the repositories section. Under the master repository, you will find Work Repositories. Right click and select **New Work Repository**.

    ![Start New Work Repository Wizard](./images/start-new-work-repo-wizard.png "Start New Work Repository Wizard")

2. In the connection properties, set the **Technology** drop down to **Oracle** and check the **Use Credential File** checkbox. Now, select the ADW wallet as the **Credential File** and choose the high connection. Finally, set **User** to ODI and provide the password to the ODI schema. Then, click **Next**.

    ![Enter Database Connection Details](./images/enter-database-connection-details.png "Enter Database Connection Details")

3. Give the work repository a name of your choosing and set a password. You can leave the repository type set to **Development**. Hit **Finish** to get a confirmation dialog and agree to creating a login with a **Yes**.

    ![Specify ODI Work Repository Properties](./images/specify-odi-work-repo-properties.png "Specify ODI Work Repository Properties")
    
    ![Create Login for Work Repository](./images/create-login-for-work-repository.png "Create Login for Work Repository")

4. Give a login name and select **OK**. This will lead to a prompt asking for the ADW wallet's password. Provide the password and click on **OK**.

    ![Enter Name for Login](./images/enter-name-for-login.png "Enter Name for Login")
    
    ![Enter Wallet Password](./images/enter-wallet-password-to-access-credentials2.png "Enter Wallet Password")

**Note:** The repository should be up and running in a couple of minutes.

## Task 5: Connect to the Work Repository

1. Select the **Designer** tab and then disconnect from the master repository.
    
    ![Disconnect from Master Repository](./images/disconnect-from-master-repo.png "Disconnect from Master Repository")

2. Click on **Connect to Repository**, enter the wallet password and then choose the Work Repository in the **login name** drop down.

    ![Enter Wallet Password](./images/enter-wallet-password.png "Enter Wallet Password")

    ![Select Work Repository from Dropdown](./images/select-work-repo-login.png "Select Work Repository from Dropdown")
    
3. Enter **SUPERVISOR** as the user and provide its credentials. Click on **OK** to get connected to the work repository.

    ![Login to Work Repository](./images/login-to-work-repo.png "Login to Work Repository")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
