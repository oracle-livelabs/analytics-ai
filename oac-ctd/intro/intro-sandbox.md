# Introduction

On this lab you will play the role of an IT/LoB analyst that usually helps the business finding the information they require.

However, this time you will use OAC to help you on your duty.

Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) is a scalable and secure public cloud service that provides a full set of capabilities to explore and perform collaborative analytics for you, your workgroup, and your enterprise.

With Oracle Analytics Cloud you also get flexible service management capabilities, including fast setup, easy scaling and patching, and automated lifecycle management.


You will get a file with Expenses data, coming from the expense records of the past few months.

Your mission is to analyze where we had overspent and why. However, as you are very professional, you will not only do that, but also answer if this will happen in the future and what actions we can take to solve the situation.

A summary of the use case is:

* Import the dataset in OAC
* Analyze the data with the search bar and find higher expenses by country
* Use Explain to find that higher expenses are in Hotels from the Sales department
* Create visuals that confirms overspent in one Hotel in Porto (Portugal)
* Add additional dataset with Provider Agreements that shows this Hotel already has an agreement discount that wasnâ€™t applied
* Make some changes to beautify the results.

**NOTE:** All data used on this lab was created with solely purpose to follow the exercises and fit on the use case. While we encourage you to play and enjoy the tool as much as you like, we cannot assure that all results of your tries and tests out of the steps provided will generate the expected outcome or any outcome at all.

If you find any issue or error during the lab, or if you have any question do not hesitate to contact the instructor. We are happy to assist you.
