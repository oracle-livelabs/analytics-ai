# Load the Formula 1 test data in your object storage bucket

## Introduction

This lab is to prepare your data and load it into your object storage bucket that you have prepared as prerequisite for this workshop 

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### About <Product/Technology> (Optional)
Enter background information here about the technology/feature or product used in this lab - no need to repeat what you covered in the introduction. Keep this section fairly concise. If you find yourself needing more than two sections/paragraphs, please utilize the "Learn More" section.

### Objectives

*List objectives for this lab using the format below*

In this lab, you will:
* Load the dataset needed for next labs into your object storage bucket

### Prerequisites (Optional)

*List the prerequisites for this lab using the format below. Fill in whatever knowledge, accounts, etc. is needed to complete the lab. Do NOT list each previous lab as a prerequisite.*

This lab assumes you have:
* All previous labs successfully completed
* The object storage bucket already created in the same compartment as the AI Data Platform and you have access to that bucket.


*Below, is the "fold"--where items are collapsed by default.*

## Task 1: Open you bucket in Oracle OCI

1. Step 1

  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use the following formats. _The filename must be in lowercase letters and CANNOT include any spaces._

	Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

	When the file type is recognized by the browser, it will attempt to render it. So you can use the following format to force the download dialog box.

	Download the [sample JSON code](files/sample.json?download=1).

  > Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin, or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)

2. Step 2

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. Example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## Task 2: Concise Task Description

1. Step 1 - tables sample

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy></copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
  ```
