This can be done  in 2 basic forms. 1 is a more narrow scope while th other has a more OCI wide scope.
Next to that, to demonstrate the integration with Autonomous AI Lakehouse it is useful to it already deployed and the credentials and wallet at hand.
It is also very useful to have a compartment structure in place and that you have identified the compartment for AI Data Platform Workbench
