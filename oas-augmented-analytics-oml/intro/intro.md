# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is designed to illustrate how organizations can blend the capabilities found in both of these offerings to uncover value across the entire data lifecycle in a way that holistically meets the needs of both **citizen & professional** data scientists.

*Estimated Workshop Time*: 1 hour

### About Product/Technology
Oracle Analytics Server (OAS) is a comprehensive enterprise analytics solution that empowers you to ask any question – of any data – in any environment – on any device.   The extensive augmented analytic capabilities surfaced throughout the product truly differentiate it from other analytic offerings.  These augmented analytics are designed to enable and support the needs of “citizen” data scientists.

Oracle Converged Database affords native support for all modern data types as well as supporting the latest development paradigms from a singular product. Most customers think of the Oracle database as a traditional relational database, but recent releases also offer support for:
* Spatial data to support location awareness  
* JSON for document stores  
* IoT for device integration  
* In-Memory technologies for real-time analytic  
* Machine Learning   

What many customers do not realize is that  these capabilities are now included free with every Oracle database license. The Machine Learning capabilities within the Oracle Database are designed to enable and support the more robust and demanding needs of **professional** data scientists.

### Objectives
This workshop illustrates you how you can leverage embedded augmented analytics and machine learning capabilities of OAS to deliver the fastest time to insight across all of your data. Additionally, you will leverage the more comprehensive set of Oracle Machine Learning (OML) algorithms, now offered for free with each of your Oracle Database licenses.
In this lab you will:
* Leverage OAS capabilities to readily add augmented analytic functions such as Trendline, Forecast, Cluster & Outlier identification to your analysis.
* Learn Predictive Analytics in OAS to predict attrition rate of an organization.
* Learn and use Oracle Machine Learning (OML) algorithms of oracle converged database.
