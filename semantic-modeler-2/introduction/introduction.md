# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is a continuation of [Model Your Data With the Semantic Modeler in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC): Part 1](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3566&clear=RR,180&session=107559302574644), which describes how to build governed semantic models using the Semantic Modeler which is currently available for preview. Ask your administrator to enable the Semantic Modeler preview feature in Console.

In the Oracle Analytics Semantic Modeler, you define the physical, logical, and presentation layers to create a semantic model, along with related objects such as variables, and initialization blocks.
