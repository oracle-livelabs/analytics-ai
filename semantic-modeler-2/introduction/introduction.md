# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is a continuation of [Model Your Data With the Semantic Modeler in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC): Part 1](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3566), which describes how to build governed semantic models using the Semantic Modeler which is currently available for preview. Ask your administrator to enable the Semantic Modeler preview feature in Console.
