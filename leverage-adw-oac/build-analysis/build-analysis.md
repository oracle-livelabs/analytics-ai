### Objectives

- Start your first simple interactive analysis

### Prerequisites

* An [_Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account_](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) or a Paid account
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Start your first analysis

Lets Start from the previous workbook and clean up the report a bit.

1.  Close **Performance Tools** pane and Remove **VALUE** from Grammar Pane Value (Y-Axis).  
Hover the mouse over the **VALUE** and click the 'x' sign.

2.  **Add Trend Line**.  
In the Properties Pane select the **Analytics** **icon** and double-click **Add Trend Line**.

4.  **Duplicate** Canvas.  
Right-click the canvas tab and select  **Duplicate**.  
This adds a copy of the selected canvas to the project’s row of canvas tabs.

5.  Lets filter on Mobile Phones.   
Right Click **Mobile Phones** Category and select **Keep Selected**.  
That keeps only the selected members and remove all others from the visualization and its linked visualizations.

6.  Move **Channel** to Color.  
Drag **CHANNEL** from Trellis Rows section and Drop it to **Color** section.

8.  Filter **CHANNEL** to **Direct Channel** .  
Right Click on **Channel** > **Create Filter** and Select **Direct**.

    ![Create Filter](../build-analysis/images/channel-create-filter.png)  
    ![Create Filter](../build-analysis/images/direct-channel.png) 

9.  Lets **Drill** on **Direct Channel** to SUB\_CATEGORY.  
Right Click > **Drill to Attribute/Hierarchy** and select Data Elements > **SUB\_CATEGORY**.  
This Drill to [Attribute Name] to directly drill to a specific attribute within a visualization.

10.  Lets look at the results for 'Customers by Sales Week and Subcategory'.

     ![Customers by Sales Week and Subcategory](../build-analysis/images/createbestviz-customerssubcategory.png)

11.  Lets analyze customers across various sub categories and choose the **Create Best Visualization** option.  
Go to **Data Panel**,  Select **# Customers**, press CTRL key and Select  **SUB\_CATEGORY**; Right Click and select **Create Best Visualization**  
A visualization is automatically created on the canvas, and the best visualization type is selected based on the preconfigured logic. The selected data element is also positioned on a specific area of the Grammar Panel.

12.  The system decided that Bar Chart was the best viz type to visualize this information.
