## Introduction

This section describes the process of deploying **Oracle Analytics Cloud** instances on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2, which is the default for newly provisioned accounts in **EMEA** and **US**.

Your Oracle Cloud Free Tier account will use the Oracle Cloud Free Trial **credits** while this instance is provisioned, as Oracle Analytics Cloud is not part of the **Always Free** cloud services.

Provisioning an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance can take up to **40 minutes**.

_Estimated Time:_ 15 minutes.
