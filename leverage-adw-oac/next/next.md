I hope you have completed all the workshops on this ADW and OAC workshop and you have learned the basic concepts from the technologies that we have used: - **Oracle Autonomous Database** - **Oracle Analytics Cloud**.

The technologies that we have covered in this workshop are using **Always Free** and **Free Trial** credits, so you don't have to pay for the services that you have used. 

If you want to **Upgrade** the Instances that we used, you can follow these simple steps to upgrade to your favorite paid subscription model.

[Here you can see the differences models that Oracle has available.](https://www.oracle.com/ie/cloud/pricing.html)

We will show you how to Upgrade from **Always Free** instances right now.

Remember that you will see **Always Free** logo next to the name of your database as part of the database details information. You can see **Instance Type** filled out with **Free Upgrade to Paid**.

1. We will upgrade to Paid License in this step. You can either click on the **Instance Type** that I  or click on **More Actions** bottom and go to **Upgrade Database Instance to Paid**, both ways bring you to the same step.

    You can observe two things:
    1. **Instance Type** information has changed from **Free Upgrade to Paid** to **Paid**
    2. The **Always Free** Logo next to the **Database Name** is not there anymore.
