After you ask your business question(s) and get  automated generated visuals, you are going to explore the visuals and gain additional insights with Advanced Analytics.

_Estimated Time:_ 20 minutes

### Objectives

- **Gain Insights** with Visuals
- Use **Advanced Analytics**

### Prerequisites

* An [_Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account_](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) or a Paid account
* All previous labs successfully completed
## Task 1: Gain Insights with Visuals

1.  **Search** for your Data Set.  
Lets go back in the web mode; in the **Home** Page of OAC, a dialog bar appearing at the top can be leveraged to **ask** your business questions using natural language.  
Click the **Search** bar and **Type** in the bar area **show me value by sales week for customers by channel**.  
As you enter the information, the application returns search results in a drop-down list. The system can be searched by column names or data elements or both. Best fit results are returned immediately

2.  Press **SHIFT + ENTER** to visualize data

    ![Visualize Data](../gain-insights/images/biask6.png)

    In order to **enable searching** and ask questions, you already have **indexed** the Data Set as part of the previous chapter.

3.  Mouse Hover on the first visualization and Click **Explore as Workbook** 

    ![Explore Data](../gain-insights/images/biask8.png)

4.  **Explore** your Visualization.  
A new Workbook will be opened  

    ![Explore Data](../gain-insights/images/valuebysalesweekforcustomersbychannel.png)

5.  You would notice that there are 2 measures, with 2 different units, on the same Y axis, which is difficult to interpret.  
We have to move one of the measure to the second Y axis and get a proper visualization.  
Change **"# Customers"** to the second Y Axis > Go to the **Grammar Panel**, under the **Values** Section, hover over "**# Customers**", right-click and select **Y2 axis**  

    ![Second Axis](../gain-insights/images/valuebysalesweekforcustomersbychannel-y2axissmall.png)

6.  Notice that the visualization has changed with **Value** scale on the left and **# Customers** scale on the right **Y axis**. 

    ![Second Axis](../gain-insights/images/valuebysalesweekforcustomersbychannel-y2axis2.png)

7.  Lets add **Category** to **Trellis Columns**.  
    Drag and drop **Category** data element from the Data Panel, to the Grammar Panel, into **Trellis Columns** section.  
   
    ![Category](../gain-insights/images/addcategorysmall.png)

8.  Notice that we are consistently losing Customers over time on Mobile Phones category.

## Task 2: Use Advanced Analytics  

You've created your visual to explore and find patterns with Value and Customers by Sales Week and Channel, and to understand the split over Categories. You spot it a decrease over Mobile Phones category.  
Now you need to enhance the insights is the data displayed and add Advanced Analytics functions as easy as the right-click of a mouse.

1. Add a **Trend Line**  
Adding Trend lines is easy. It is used to analyze the specific direction of a group of value sets.  

    Right-click your visualization, select **Add Statistics** and choose **Trend Line**.

    ![Add Trend Line](../gain-insights/images/addtrendline.png)

2.  Notice that there is **downward trend** for **Mobile Phones**. 

    ![Add Trend Line](../gain-insights/images/addtrendline2.png)

3.  **Properties** of the Trend Line can be controlled on the "**Chart Properties**" pane from bottom left side.  
Go to **Analytics** tab, and is you click on "Linear" you can select a different Method (Exponential, Polynomial).

    ![Trend Line Properties Pane](../gain-insights/images/addtrendline-properties.png)  
    It's Linear Trend with 95% Confidence Interval.  
    > **Note:** please check this [blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/analytics/how-to-add-functions-with-a-simple-right-click-in-oracle-analytics) for details

4.  Add a **Forecast**  
Adding a **Forecast** is pretty much the same process as the Trend lines one.  

    Forecasting is the process of making predictions about the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.  
    Right-click your visualization, select **Add Statistics** and choose **Forecast**.  
    
    ![Add Forecast](../gain-insights/images/addforecastsmall.png)

5.  The forecast line predicts a further decline in the number of customers for Mobile Phones.

    ![Add Forecast](../gain-insights/images/addforecast2.png)

6.  The **Properties** of the Forecast can be controlled on the "**Chart Properties**" pane from bottom left side.  
Go to **Analytics** tab, and click on "Linear" you can select a different Method (ARIMA, ETS).

    ![Forecast Properties Pane](../gain-insights/images/addforecast-propertiessmall.png)  
    Method is Next 3 periods, Model is Seasonal ARIMA (a regular pattern of changes that repeats over time periods), with 95% Prediction Interval.  
    > if you want more control over the various options for the computation you can create a [custom calculations](https://blogs.oracle.com/analytics/how-to-add-functions-with-a-simple-right-click-in-oracle-analytics) using Analytics functions.

You have just finished to learn how to start from direct questions on your data. You can move and explore automated generated visuals and enhancing by adding one-click advanced analytics functions to get further future looking insights.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
