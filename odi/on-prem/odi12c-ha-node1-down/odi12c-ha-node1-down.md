# Run ODI Job when Primary ODI Server is Down

## Introduction
In this lab user will bring down the primary ODI services and understand how the secondary ODI agent will execute the job and vice versa.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 15 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab you will learn
* Shutdown the Primary ODI Server
* Run ODI Job when Primary Agent is Down
* Start the Primary ODI Server

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup
    - Lab: Initialize Environment
    - Lab: ODI HA Configuration
    - Lab: Run ODI Job when both Nodes are Up


## Task 1: Shutdown the Primary ODI Server

1. Open the chrome browser in desktop and navigate to *Weblogic Server Administration Console* login page using below URL, click on the *Username* field and provide the credentials below to login. The weblogic is configured on 7005 for this labs.

    - URL

    ```
      <copy>http://odiha-1:7005/console</copy>
    ```  

    - Username

    ```
      <copy>weblogic</copy>
    ```

    - Password

    ```
      <copy>Welcome1#</copy>
    ```
    
    ![Weblogic login page](images/weblogic-login.png " ")

2. In the weblogic home page, click on "Servers".

  ![Weblogic home page](images/weblogic-home.png " ")

3. "Summary of Servers" will be displayed on screen. Click on "Control" tab.

  ![Summary of servers configuration tab](images/weblogic-server-status.png " ")

4. Select ODI_server1, shutdown and **Force shutdown now** option.

  ![Force Shutdown server option](images/weblogic-odi1-down.png " ")

5. Refresh the page and the **ODI_server1** status will be changed to SHUTDOWN.

  ![ODI server1 state in summary of servers](images/odi1-down-status.png " ")

Now, the primary ODI server is down, you can execute the ODI mapping and observe that odi server in node2 will execute the ODI jobs and will act as primary node.


## Task 2: Run ODI Job when Primary Agent is Down

1. Open ODI Studio in Node1 or Node2, navigate to Designer tab and drill down on "HA_Demo".

  ![Designer tab in ODI](./images/odi-designer-1.png " ")

2. Drill Down on "Demo" folder, "Mappings" and double click on "Load File to DB".

  ![Mappings in HA_Demo project](./images/odi-designer-2.png " ")

   "Load File to DB" is a simple one-to-one mapping which extract the data from flatfile and load the data into target database. The target table "User_Login" has one additional column called **load\_date** which loads the system date to the table.

  ![Load File to DB mapping](./images/odi-designer-3.png " ")

 **Note:** The truncate target table is set to true in ODI Mapping because of which only latest run data will be present the target table. If historical data is required, change this option to false.

   ![Physical tab in Load File to DB mapping](./images/odi-designer-4.png " ")

3. Click on the "Run" icon to execute the mapping.

  ![Run icon](./images/odi-designer-run.png " ")

4. Run box will appear on the screen. Change the Logical Agent to "OracleDIAgent" and click "OK".

  ![Run box](./images/odi-run-box.png " ")

5. Session started message will appear on screen. Click "OK".

  ![Session started message](./images/odi-session-start.png " ")

6. Go to operator tab and check the status of the job.

  ![Operator tab in ODI](./images/odi-operator-1.png " ")

  Green tick mark indicates that the job is successful.

7. Verify the data in target table by running the below SQL query.

   ```
    <copy>
    select * from target.user_login;
    </copy>
   ```
  ![SQL Developer window](./images/sql-developer-3.png " ")
 

  Hostname in above screenshot is "odiha-2". This clearly indicates that the above job is executed by Node2 ODI agent. As the primary ODI server is down the job is routed to Node2 ODI server.


## Task 3: Start the Primary ODI Server

1. Login to **Weblogic Admin page** and go to the control tab in the **Summary of Servers** page. Select **ODI_server1** and click on start.

  ![Summary of servers in weblogic window](./images/weblogic-odi1-start.png " ")

2. Refresh the page after some time and ODI server state will be changed to "RUNNING".

  ![Summary of servers](./images/odi1-start-status.png " ")

3. Shutdown the "ODI_Server2", run the ODI job using steps 3 to 7 in Task 2 and verify the data in SQL Developer.

  ![Summary of servers](./images/odi1-start-status.png " ")

  ![SQL developer query window](./images/sql-developer-4.png " ")

Now, hostname in above screenshot is "odiha-1".  This clearly indicates that the above job is executed by Node1 ODI agent.

Congratulations, you have completed the workshop!
