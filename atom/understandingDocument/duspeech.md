# Using Document Understanding & Speech service

## Introduction

This lab will take you through the steps needed to use Document Understanding & Speech service

Estimated Time: 2 hours 30 minutes

### About Oracle Document Understanding & Speech service

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Document Understanding is an AI service that enables developers to extract text, tables, and other key data from document files through APIs and command line interface tools. With OCI Document Understanding, you can automate tedious business processing tasks with prebuilt AI models and customize document extraction to fit your industry-specific needs.

OCI Speech is an AI service that uses automatic speech recognition technology to transform audio content to text and textual content to speech. Get accurate, text-normalized, time-stamped transcriptions via the OCI console, OCI Data Science notebooks, and REST APIs as well as command-line interfaces or SDKs.

### Objectives

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account
* Access to the Chicago and Ashburn Region
* Administrator permissions or permissions to use the Generative AI family, the AI services family, Digital Assistant, Visual Builder and Identity Domains

## Task 1: Provision Oracle Digital Assistant

This task will help you to create Oracle Digital Assistant under your chosen compartment. OCI Document Understanding service is only available in Ashburn region. Since we're using Ashburn region for this we will have to create a new Digital Assistant in Ashburn region.

1. Locate Digital Assistant under AI Services

   ![Navigate to Digital Assistant](images/oda_provision_1.png)

   > **Note:** You can find Digital Assistant under the AI Services.

2. Provide the information for **Compartment**, **Name** , **Description** (optional) & **Shape**. Click **Create**

    ![Create ODA](images/oda_provision_3.png)

3. In few minutes the status of recently created Digital Assistant will change from **Provisioning** to **Active**

## Task 2: Policy creation for Oracle Document Understanding and Speech Access

Create a Dynamic Group
Go to Identity>>Domains>>Default domain>>Dynamic groups

![Navigate to Domains](images/domain.png)

Click on Create dynamic group and name it as odaDynamicGroup

Select radio button - Match any rules defined below
Add the following rules

Rule 1

```text
     <copy>
    All {instance.id = 'ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXX'}
     </copy>
```

Note - This will be ocid of Digital Assistant in Chicago region

Rule 2

```text
     <copy>
    All {resource.type='odainstance', resource.compartment.id='ocid1.compartment.oc1..XXXX' }
    </copy>
 ```

Rule 3

```text
    <copy>
    ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..XXXX'}
     </copy>
```

Rule 4

```text
     <copy>
    All {instance.id = 'ocid1.odainstance.oc1.iad.XXX'}
    </copy>
```

Note - This will be ocid of Digital Assistant in Ashburn region

This task will help you to create necessary policy for the Oracle Document Understanding Service

1. Attach the policy at the root compartment level

    ODA_Access - Policy to allow users access to ODA

    ```text
        <copy>
        Allow any-user to use ai-service-generative-ai-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
        Allow any-user to use generative-ai-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
        Allow any-user to use fn-invocation in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
        Allow dynamic-group odaDynamicGroup to use fn-invocation in tenancy
        </copy>
    ```

    API-Gateway-Policy - Policy to allow API Gateway to access functions for atom

     ```text
        <copy>
        ALLOW any-user to use functions-family in compartment vb where ALL {request.principal.type= 'ApiGateway', request.resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..XXXX'}
        </copy>
    ```

    ODA-Speech-Policy - Allows ODA Dev to connect to speech service. Also includes access to object storage.

    ```text
        <copy>
        allow any-user to manage ai-service-speech-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXX'

        allow any-user to manage object-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXX'

        allow any-user to read tag-namespaces in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXX'

        allow dynamic-group odaDynamicGroup to manage ai-service-speech-family in tenancy

        allow dynamic-group odaDynamicGroup to manage object-family in tenancy

        allow dynamic-group odaDynamicGroup to read tag-namespaces in tenancy

        ALLOW dynamic-group odaDynamicGroup to use fn-invocation in compartment vb

        Allow dynamic-group odaDynamicGroup to read objectstorage-namespaces in tenancy

        Allow dynamic-group odaDynamicGroup to manage logging-family in compartment vb

        Allow dynamic-group odaDynamicGroup to read metrics in compartment vb

     ```

    > **Note:**
    > * Please make sure that the compartmentId should be the one under which the resource is  created.

## Task 3: Create REST Service

This task involves creating REST service which will be used by ODA to connect to OCI Generative AI Service. The REST Service will be created for the ODA created in **Task 1**. This step only needs to be done once per ODA instance. If users are sharing one ODA instance to create multiple chatbot, only the first person will need to perform this step

1. Locate the ODA created in **Task 1**
