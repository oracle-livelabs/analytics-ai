Estimated Time: 1 hours 30 minutes

### About Oracle Digital Assistant

Oracle Digital Assistant delivers a complete AI platform to create conversational experiences for business applications through text, chat, and voice interfaces

### Objectives

Provisioning of ODA

In this lab, you will:

* An Oracle account
* Access to the Chicago Region
* Administrator permissions or permissions to use the Generative AI family, the AI services family, Digital Assistant, Visual Builder and Identity Domains

## Task 1: Provision Oracle Digital Assistant

This task will help you to create Oracle Digital Assistant under your choosen compartment.

1. Locate Digital Assistant under AI Services

   ![Navigate to Digital Assistant](images/oda_provision_1.png)

   > **Note:** You can find Digital Assistant under the AI Services.

2. Provide the information for **Compartment**, **Name** , **Description** (optional) & **Shape**. Click **Create**

    ![Create ODA](images/oda_provision_3.png)

3. In few minutes the status of recently created Digital Assistant will change from **Provisioning** to **Active**

## Task 2: Dynamic Group & Policy creation for Oracle Digital Assistant

This task will help you to create desired dynamic group & necessary policy for the Oracle Digital Assistant

1. Attach the policy at the root compartment level. Please change the values of OCIDs to your own values here.

    ```text
    <copy>
    Allow any-user to use ai-service-generative-ai-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    Allow any-user to use generative-ai-family in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    Allow any-user to use fn-invocation in tenancy where request.principal.id='ocid1.odainstance.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    </copy>
    ```

    > **Note:**
    > * Please make sure that the compartmentId should be the one under which the resource is  created.

## Task 3: Create REST Service for the OCI Generative AI Service

This task involves creating REST service which will be used by ODA to connect to OCI Generative AI Service. The REST Service will be created for the ODA created in **Task 1**.  This step only needs to be done once per ODA instance. If users are sharing one ODA instance to create multiple chatbot, only the first person will need to perform this step

1. Locate the ODA created in **Task 1**

    ![ODA List](images/oda_list.png)

2. Select the earlier created ODA Instance and click on **Service Console**

    ![ODA Service Console](images/oda_provision_4.png)

3. Click on hamburger menu and locate & click **API Services**

    ![API Services](images/oda_api_service.png)

4. Click on **Add REST Service**. Provide the following details. Please note you will have to change values of CompartmentID and modelID to your own ID values in the Body section. You can follow the next step - Step 5 to see how to retrieve model ID.
    * **Name**

    ```text
    <copy>
    Gen_AI_Service
    </copy>
    ```

    * **Endpoint**

    ```text
    <copy>
    https://inference.generativeai.us-chicago-1.oci.oraclecloud.com/20231130/actions/chat
     </copy>
    ```

    * **Description (Optional)** : `Optional`
    * **Authentication Type** : OCI Resource Principal
    * **Method** : POST
    * **Request**
    * **Body**

    ```text
    <copy>
    {
        "compartmentId": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..XXXXXXXXXXX",
        "servingMode": {
            "modelId": "ocid1.generativeaimodel.oc1.us-chicago-1.XXXXXXXX",
            "servingType": "ON_DEMAND"
        },
        "chatRequest": {
            "apiFormat": "COHERE",
            "message": "Hi, how are you",
            "isStream": true
        }
    }
    </copy>
    ```

5. This step is broken down into following 3 steps
    * Step 1: Click on hamburger menu of OCI console and select **AI Services** > **Generative AI**

    ![API Services](images/genai.png)

    * Step 2: Select Chat (under **Playground** heading)

    ![API Services](images/model_screenshot.png)

    * Step 3: For the **Model**=**cohere.command-r-plus v1.2**, Click **View Model Details**, and then click on **copy** link for the **cohere.command-r-plus** and **version** = 1.2

    ![API Services](images/chat_screenshot.png)

6. Click **Test Request** to make sure the connection is successful

   ![API Services](images/oci_rest_service_3.png)

    > **Note**
    > * Retrieve the modelId (OCID) from OCI Gen AI Services Playground and use a compartmentId where the ODA is hosted inside
    > * If you are using a different name (and not Gen AI Service) for your Rest service then please make a change in your LLM Provider in Settings as well. To do that Go to Skills -> Settings -> Configuration -> Large Language Model Services -> LLM Provider. Choose the new Rest Service for both GenAI LLM and  GenAI Truncate LLM

    ![Create Channel](images/skill_channel1.png)

## Task 6: Create VBCS Instance & embed ODA skill in VBCS Application (Please directly move to Step 5 incase you already have a VBCS instance provisioned)

1. Click on main hamburger menu on OCI cloud console and navigate Developer Services > Visual Builder

    ![Create Channel](images/visual_builder.png)

2. Create Visual Builder Instance by providing the details and click **Create Visual Builder Instance**:
    * **Name** = <name_of_your_choice>
    * **Compartment** = <same_compartment_as_oda>
    * **Node** = <as_per_need>

    ![Create Channel](images/create_vbcs.png)

3. Wait for the instance to come to **Active** (green color) status

4. Click on the link to download the VB application (zip file): [ATOM_VB.zip](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/UcaJRNLr-UXQ55zFIOdS_rloRYfUSYA49sRGZsBON3ZNYncODcwC1DLdz7Xw4PJd/n/c4u02/b/hosted_workshops/o/ATOM_VB.zip)

5. Import the application in provisioned instance as per the screenshots. Users only need one VCBS instance created. They can import/create multiple applications in the instance for each additional chatbot they have

    * Click on Import from Visual Builder Instance

        ![Create Channel](images/import_vbapp.png)

    * Choose the option as below

        ![Create Channel](images/import_vbapp_1.png)

    * Provide the App Name with other details and select the provided application zip file

        ![Create Channel](images/import_vbapp_2.png)

6. Once import is completed, open the index.html file in the VB Instance and update the details as follows:

    * **URI** = '<https://oda-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.data.digitalassistant.oci.oraclecloud.com/>'
    * **channelId** = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    * Please change value of initUserHiddenMessage on Line 32 from 'what can you do' to 'Hello'

    ![Create Channel](images/vbapp_setup.png)

    > **Note**
    > * URI is the hostname of ODA instance provisioned in **Task 1**
    > * channelId is created during **Task 5** - **Step 3**

7. The UI of the chatbot such as theme, color and icon can be changed by modifying the parameters under var chatWidgetSetting from index.html

8. Click on the Play button shown in the above image on the top right corner to launch ATOM chatbot and start chatting with ATOM.

9. You may face an issue when you go to publish the live link of the application. It may throw a "forbidden" error. The solution is to remove the "Admin" and "User" role in the JSON tab from all the vb pages - main-start, main-embedded-chat, and the shell page as shown in the image below.
