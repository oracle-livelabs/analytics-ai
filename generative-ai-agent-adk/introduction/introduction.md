# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop will help you configure, deploy, and run a chat powered by OCI Generative AI Agents using the OCI Agent Development Kit (adk). During the flow, the learner will:

- Create and configure OCI Generative AI Agents.
- Configure tools such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), NL2SQL, and custom tools including Model Context Protocol (MCP)-based tools.
- Use adk for all the above tasks.

### Objectives

The objective of this workshop is to configure, build, deploy, and run OCI Generative AI Agents using the Agent Development Kit (**ADK**). The following services and features will be covered during the lab:

* OCI Generative AI Agent build and deploy
* Configure and use the inbuilt Retrieval Augmented Generation (**RAG**) tool
* Configure and use the inbuilt Natural Language to SQL tool (**NL2SQL**)
* Use Model Context Protocol (**MCP**) with OCI Generative AI Agent
* Configure and use custom tools with OCI Generative AI Agents

- OCI Generative AI Agent build and deploy
- Configure and use the inbuilt Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tool
- Configure and use the inbuilt Natural Language to SQL tool (NL2SQL)
- Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) with OCI Generative AI Agents
- Configure and use custom tools with OCI Generative AI Agents

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud Account (Non-Free Tier).
* Access to OCI Generative AI Agents.
* Access to a region where the Agent service is available. 
    * Refer [here for more.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/overview.htm#regions)
* An OCI compartment for allocating all necessary resources.
