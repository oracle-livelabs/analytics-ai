# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The Premier League has contacted you and asked for your expertise. The Premier League wants to be able to present and display a map during their in-game broadcasts showing where the ball enters the net when an opposing team scores a penalty goal. The Premier League has said they want to do this because it will increase fan engagement and spark interesting conversations with data and visualizations. They recognize that visualized data often enables users to ask questions they may not have otherwise asked. This data will also be able for the fans to explore on an interactive publicly available embedded analytics website. This will empower fans to feel more invested in the players that they support.

You have agreed to demonstrate this capability in Oracle Analytics Cloud using historic data from the players across the Premier League.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hours 30 minutes
