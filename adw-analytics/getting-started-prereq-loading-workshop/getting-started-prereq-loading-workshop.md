# Getting Started

## Workshop Prerequisite

***Before starting this workshop, you will need to have completed the related LiveLabs workshop***, **Autonomous Data Warehouse: Data Loading and Management Using SQL on the MovieStream Dataset**.

The **Getting Started** section of that prerequisite workshop describes how to obtain an Oracle cloud account if you do not already have one. In that workshop you provision an Oracle Autonomous Database, and then load the MovieStream data needed for this analytics workshop.
