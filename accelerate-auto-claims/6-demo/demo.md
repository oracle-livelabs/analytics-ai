# implement OAC Instance

## Introduction

This lab will walk you thru staging and loading of autoclaims data into the Autonomous Database created in previous steps. You will stage data in an object storage bucket, use the api key to create a cloud store for the object storage bucket, load data from the bucket into the autonomous database and create an auto table using parquet files in object storage bucket.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives


In this lab, you will:
* Import OAC Workbooks
* Update Dataset Connection
* Update Dataset's

### Prerequisites

 
This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud account with privileges to access Generative AI services, provision Autonomous Database and add API keys
 

## Task 1: Create Object Storage Bucket

## Task 2: Create external table for parquet files

## Task 3: Create new Cloud Store Location

## Task 4: Load Object Storage data into Autonomous Database via Cloud Store
