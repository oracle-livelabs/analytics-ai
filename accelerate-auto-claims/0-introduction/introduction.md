# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this hands-on live lab, you’ll learn how to provision and set up Oracle AI Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics Cloud to modernize and optimize the insurance claims process. Guided by practical scenarios, you’ll use advanced analytics and AI-driven tools to automatically categorize and summarize claims data, helping to detect and reduce premium leakage.
Participants will walk through the provisioning and setup of Autonomous AI Database and Analytics Cloud. Upon completion, you will have a working environment that can be used to flag suspicious claims for investigation and foster clear communication with policyholders or agents about missing details. The workshop spotlights the collaboration between Claims Team Supervisors and Claims Analysts, demonstrating how Oracle’s AI solutions enable teams to efficiently analyze complex data, identify instances of fraud and inefficiency, and implement process improvements.
Through a series of interactive exercises, you’ll explore how to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies within policy and claims data, realizing benefits like increased accuracy, substantial time savings, and actionable insights—all while maintaining strong oversight through human-in-the-loop processes. Harnessing built-in AI and machine learning capabilities, you’ll learn to unify diverse data sources, detect inconsistencies, and predict potential premium leakage, empowering your insurance organization to make smarter decisions, ensure compliance, and reinforce the integrity of claims operations.
