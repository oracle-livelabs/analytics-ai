# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop will help to configure Generative AI powered chatbot (PICASO) on your own OCI tenancy.
This workshop enables developers to perform GenAI RAG on custom PeopleSoft PDF documents (stored in OCI Object Storage) using the OCI Generative AI Agent Service.
The users can then

- Connect to OCI Generative AI Agent Service from OCI Digital Assistant Chatbot PICASO (hosted in PeopleSoft Application)
- Get responses of their question (in natural language) from those custom PeopleSoft PDF documents.

By following the workshop users can install PICASO with Gen AI Agent integration in their own tenancy

* OCI Object Storage Service – Users can configure OCI Object Storage and create Buckets.
Users can then upload their own unstructured PDF manuals / documents in those buckets.
* OCI Generative AI Agent Service – Users can configure OCI Generative AI Agent Service (create and configure Knowledge Bases and Agents).
Users can then ingest and perform RAG on the user’s documents in OCI Object Storage, using OCI Generative AI Agent Service.
* OCI Digital Assistant (ODA) – Users can create ODA instance and import the provided ODA Skill.
Users can then connect from ODA chatbot to OCI Generative AI Agent Service, leveraging OCI Functions Rest Service.
* OCI PeopleSoft Application – User can create OCI PeopleSoft instance using OCI Marketplace image.
Users can then embed the ODA chatbot (PICASO) in PeopleSoft application. Then the users can get responses from their PDF manuals / documents, using PICASO Chatbot within PeopleSoft Application.

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Create Object Storage Buckets, and upload custom PDF documents in those buckets
* Setup & configure Generative AI Agent Service (Knowledge Bases and Agents)
* Setup & configure ODA (PICASO) as a LLM powered chatbot in PeopleSoft Application
* Test out the features and capabilities of PICASO Chatbot in PeopleSoft
