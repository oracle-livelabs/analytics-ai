## What is Essbase?

Oracle Essbase products provide companies the ability to deliver critical business information to the right people when they need it. With Essbase, companies quickly leverage and integrate data from multiple existing data sources and distribute filtered information to end-user communities in the format that best meets the users’ needs. Users interact and intuitively explore data in real time and along familiar business dimensions, enabling them to perform speed-of thought analytics.

## What is OAC?

Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) is a scalable and secure public cloud service that provides a full set of capabilities to explore and perform collaborative analytics for you, your workgroup, and your enterprise.

With Oracle Analytics Cloud, you get flexible service management capabilities, including fast setup, easy scaling and patching, and automated lifecycle management.

Key use cases of Essbase and OAC integration include:

Essbase does not have any reporting capabilities on its own, hence OAC can be leveraged.

OAC provides various reporting capabilities for different types of users.
