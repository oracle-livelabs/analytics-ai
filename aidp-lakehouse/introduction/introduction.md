# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Welcome to **Lakehouse Analytics with AI Data Platform**!  
This hands-on workshop guides you through building a modern data analytics pipeline on Oracle Cloud using **Oracle AI Data Platform** (AIDP), **Autonomous AI Lakehouse**, and **Oracle Analytics Cloud** (OAC). You will experience the full "lakehouse" pattern: ingesting, transforming, and analyzing airline operations data step by step.

You'll learn how to:
- Load raw airline data into Oracle Object Storage
- Use AIDP and Delta Lake to clean, enrich, and prepare data for analytics
- Serve curated datasets from **Autonomous AI Lakehouse** for interactive analytics
- Visualize insights and KPIs in OAC dashboards

> **Estimated Workshop Time:** 3 hours

---

### Objectives

By completing this workshop, you will:
- Understand key lakehouse architecture principles using Oracle Cloud services
- Build ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines with Spark and Delta Lake in **AI Data Platform**
- Prepare and publish analytics-ready data to **Autonomous AI Lakehouse**
- Design data visualizations and dashboards with **Oracle Analytics Cloud** (OAC)
