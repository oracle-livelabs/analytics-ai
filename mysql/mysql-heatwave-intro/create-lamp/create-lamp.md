![mysql heatwave](./images/mysql-heatwave-logo.jpg "mysql heatwave")

## Introduction

MySQL HeatWave can easily be used for development tasks with existing Oracle services, such as Oracle Cloud Analytics. New applications can also be created with the LAMP or other software stacks.


_Estimated Lab Time:_ 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will be guided through the following tasks:

- Create SSH Key on OCI Cloud
- Create Compute Instance
- Install MySQL Shell on the Compute Instance
- Test connection to MySQL Database System
- Install Apache and PHP
- Create PHP / MYSQL Connect Application
- Create Google Chart Application

### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Trial or Paid Cloud Account
- Some Experience with MySQL Shell
- Must Complete Lab 4

## Task 1: Create SSH Key on OCI Cloud Shell

The Cloud Shell machine is a small virtual machine running a Bash shell which you access through the Oracle Cloud Console (Homepage). You will start the Cloud Shell and generate a SSH Key to use  for the Bastion  session.

1. To start the Oracle Cloud shell, go to your Cloud console and click the cloud shell icon at the top right of the page. This will open the Cloud Shell in the browser, the first time it takes some time to generate it.

    cloudshell-main

    ![cloud shell main](./images/cloud-shell.png  "cloud shell main " )

    ![cloud shell button](./images/cloud-shell-setup.png  "cloud shell button " )

    ![open cloud shell](./images/cloud-shell-open.png "open cloud shell" )

    ![click public network](./images/cloud-shell-public-ntework.png "click public network" )



    _Note: You can use the icons in the upper right corner of the Cloud Shell window to minimize, maximize, restart, and close your Cloud Shell session._

2. Once the cloud shell has started, create the SSH Key using the following command:

    ```bash
    <copy>ssh-keygen -t rsa</copy>
    ```

    Press enter for each question.

    Here is what it should look like.  

    ![ssh key](./images/ssh-key-show.png "ssh key show")

3. The public  and  private SSH keys  are stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

4. Examine the two files that you just created.

    ```bash
    <copy>cd .ssh</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>ls</copy>
    ```

    ![ssh key list ](./images/shh-key-list.png "shh key list")

    Note in the output there are two files, a *private key:* `id_rsa` and a *public key:* `id_rsa.pub`. Keep the private key safe and don't share its content with anyone. The public key will be needed for various activities and can be uploaded to certain systems as well as copied and pasted to facilitate secure communications in the cloud.

## Task 2: Create Compute instance

You will need a compute Instance to connect to your brand new MySQL database.

1. Before creating the Compute instance open a notepad

2. Do the followings steps to copy the public SSH key to the  notepad

    Open the Cloud shell
    ![open cloud shell large](./images/cloud-shell-open-large.png "open cloud shell large ")

    Enter the following command

    ```bash
    <copy>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</copy>
    ```

    ![ssh key display](./images/ssh-key-display.png "ssh key display ")

3. Copy the id_rsa.pub content the notepad

    Your notepad should look like this
    ![show ssh key](./images/notepad-rsa-key.png "show ssh key")

4. Minimize cloud shell

    ![minimize cloud shell](./images/ssh-key-display-minimize.png "minimize cloud shell")

    4. Click the **Select Image** button
        ![Compute image and shape change](./images/compute-image-change.png "Compute image and shape change")

12. In the final **Image and Shape** field, keep the default shape and the new **Oracle Linux 8** image , and click **Next**.
   ![New Compute image and shape](./images/compute-image-shape.png "New Compute image and shape")

13. Under **Security** panel, click **Next**.

14. Under **Networking** panel, in **Primary network** field, select **Select existing virtual cloud network**, and ensure the following settings are selected:

    - **Virtual cloud network compartment**: **turbo**

    - **Virtual cloud network**: **heatwave-vcn**

15. Under **Subnet**, ensure the following are selected:

    - **Subnet compartment**: **turbo**

    - **Subnet**: **public-subnet-heatwave-vcn**

16. In **Primary VNIC IP addresses** field, ensure the following settings are selected:

    - **Private IPv4 address**: **Automatically assign private IPv4 address**

    - **Automatically assign public IPv4 address**: Enabled
