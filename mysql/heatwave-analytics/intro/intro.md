## About this Workshop

This workshop will walk you through the process to deploy and configure MySQL Database Service & HeatWave to run Analytics workloads in Oracle Cloud. 
 
Oracle MySQL HeatWave is the only MySQL cloud service with a built-in, high performance, in-memory query accelerator—HeatWave. It increases MySQL performance by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads, without any changes to existing applications. With HeatWave enabled, MySQL HeatWave is 6.5X faster than Amazon Redshift at half the cost, 7X faster than Snowflake at one-fifth the cost, and 1400X faster than Amazon Aurora at half the cost. MySQL HeatWave provides a single, unified platform for transactional and analytics workloads. This eliminates the need for the complex, time-consuming, expensive ETL and integration with a separate analytics database. HeatWave’s MySQL Autopilot automates provisioning, data loading, query execution, and failure handling—saving developers and DBAs significant time.

At the end of the workshop you will be able to run some queries on a sample dataset loaded into MySQL Database Service and compare the execution times with and without HeatWave. Prepare yourself to be surprised! 
 
Estimated Workshop Time: 100 minutes
