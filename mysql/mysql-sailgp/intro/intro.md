## About this Workshop

This exciting lab merges sports with technological innovation. You'll work with the latest **MySQL HeatWave Lakehouse** features to dive into the secrets behind winning in **SailGP**!

**MySQL HeatWave Lakehouse**'s power lies in its ability to query hundreds of terabytes of data directly from object storage—as fast as querying data inside the database.

**SailGP** offers you the perfect playground to try out HeatWave Lakehouse. The high speed, high tech boats contain over 800 IoT sensors that provide more than 12,000 data points, and the teams are continuously looking for insights into that data to improve their chances of winning.

This is your chance to see what it is to be a "Data Athlete" for SailGP and help the sailing teams increase their performance. Along the way, you will learn to use techniques like data visualization and machine learning!

Off to the races!
