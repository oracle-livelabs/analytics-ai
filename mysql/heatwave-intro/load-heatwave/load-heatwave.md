## Introduction

A HeatWave cluster comprise of a MySQL DB System node and two or more HeatWave nodes. The MySQL DB System node includes a plugin that is responsible for cluster management, loading data into the HeatWave cluster, query scheduling, and returning query result.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will be guided through the following task:

- Add a HeatWave Cluster to MySQL Database System
- Load Airportdb Data into HeatWave

### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Trial or Paid Cloud Account
- Some Experience with MySQL Shell
- Completed Lab 2

## Task 1: Add a HeatWave Cluster to MDS-HW MySQL Database System

1. Open the navigation menu  
    Databases
    MySQL
    DB Systems
2. Choose the root Compartment. A list of DB Systems is displayed.
    ![mysql menu](./images/10addheat01.png "mysql menu ")
3. In the list of DB Systems, click the **MDS-HW** system. click **More Action ->  Add HeatWave Cluster**.
    ![db list](./images/10addheat02.png " db list")
4. On the “Add HeatWave Cluster” dialog, select “MySQL.HeatWave.VM.Standard.E3” shape
5. Click “Estimate Node Count” button
    ![node count estimate](./images/10addheat03.png "node count estimate ")
6. On the “Estimate Node Count” page, click “Generate Estimate”. This will trigger the auto
provisioning advisor to sample the data stored in InnoDB and based on machine learning
algorithm, it will predict the number of nodes needed.
    ![predict number of nodes](./images/10addheat04.png "predict number of nodes ")
7. Once the estimations are calculated, it shows list of database schemas in MySQL node. If you expand the schema and select different tables, you will see the estimated memory required in the Summary box, There is a Load Command (heatwave_load) generated in the text box window, which will change based on the selection of databases/tables
8. Select the airportdb schema and click “Apply Node Count Estimate” to apply the node count
    ![apply node count](./images/10addheat05.png "apply node count ")
9. Click “Add HeatWave Cluster” to create the HeatWave cluster
    ![create heatwave cluster](./images/10addheat06.png " create heatwave cluster")
10. HeatWave creation will take about 10 minutes. From the DB display page scroll down to the Resources section. Click the **HeatWave** link. Your completed HeatWave Cluster Information section will look like this:

## Task 2: Load airportdb Data into HeatWave Cluster

1. If not already connected with SSH, connect to Compute instance using Cloud Shell

    (Example: **ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@132.145.17....**)

2. On command Line, connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool with the following command:

    ```
    <copy>mysqlsh -uadmin -p -h 10.0.1... --sql </copy>
    ```

3. Run the following Auto Parallel Load command to load the airportdb tables into HeatWave..

    ![auto parallel load](./images/heatwave-load-01-shell.png "auto parallel load ")

    ```
    <copy>CALL sys.heatwave_load(JSON_ARRAY('airportdb'), NULL);</copy>
    ```

4. The completed load cluster screen should look like this:

    ![load cluster](./images/heatwave-load-02.png "load cluster ")

    ![completed load cluster](./images/heatwave-load-03.png "completed load cluster ")

5.	Verify that the tables are loaded in the HeatWave cluster. Loaded tables have an AVAIL_RPDGSTABSTATE load status.

    ```
    <copy>USE performance_schema;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>SELECT NAME, LOAD_STATUS FROM rpd_tables,rpd_table_id WHERE rpd_tables.ID = rpd_table_id.ID;</copy>
    ```
