# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop will basically walk you through stages where you will be spining a MySQL Database System with **HeatWave Cluster** on **Oracle Cloud** and experience how **HeatWave engine** increase performance as compare to **Normal MySQL** when running analytics queries or other queries which uses **HeatWave engine** to process.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes

### About Oracle MySQL Database Service

**Oracle MySQL Database Service** is a fully managed database service that lets developers quickly develop and deploy secure, cloud native applications using the world’s most popular open source database. MySQL Database Service is the only MySQL cloud service with an integrated, high performance, in-memory query accelerator—**HeatWave**. It enables customers to run sophisticated analytics directly against their operational MySQL databases—eliminating the need for complex, time-consuming, and expensive data movement and integration with a separate analytics database. **HeatWave** accelerates MySQL performance by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads. Optimized for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), MySQL Database Service is 100% built, managed, and supported by the OCI and MySQL engineering teams.
