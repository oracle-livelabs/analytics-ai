## Troubleshooting

### Lab Create MySQL Database Service
- Enable HeatWave

Error: `attribute = {heatWaveCluster.shapeFamily}, value = {MySQL.HeatWave.VM.Standard.E3} - for this cluster shape the MySQL instance shape must be the same`

![Heatwave error shape](images/heatwave-error-shape.png)

> Note: You need to use HeatWave Shape when you created MySQL Database Service.
>
> Terminate your current MySQL Instance and create a new one with HeatWave valid shape, for example: `MySQL.HeatWave.VM.Standard.E3`.
>
> Enable HeatWave should work with the new shape.
