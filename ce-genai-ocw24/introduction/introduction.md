# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Enterprise runs multiple lines of business and have different business groups who generates, maintains, and consumes many business dashboards. Having an intelligent search engine allows business user to 
easily search and quickly find the right business dashboard within enterprise's system can accelerate user's daily work. Leveraging the power of Large Language Model (LLM) and Retrieval Augmented  Generation (RAG),
company can build a chatbot where user can search for business dashboards based on dashboard contents, data sources, or other dashboards metadata in natural language style. 

Large Language Models (LLM) are deep learning models that can comprehend and generate human language text. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method for generating text 
using additional information fetched from an external data source.

In this workshop, we will create a chatbot powered by Generative AI LLM with RAG to search Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) dashboards using Oracle Generative AI Agents, Open Search, and OCI services.
