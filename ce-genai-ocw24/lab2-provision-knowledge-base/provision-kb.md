# Provision Knowledge Base

## About this Workshop

In this lab you will learn how to provision AI Agent Knowledge Base with OCI Open Search Cluster.

An agent connects to a knowledge base, which is a vector-based storage that enables the integration or ingestion of data from a data source. Data sources provide connection information to the data stores that an agent uses to generate responses.
Generative AI Agent can connect with supported data sources using Oracle Vector 23ai, OCI Open Search Cluster, and Object Storage.

Estimated Workshop Time: 15 minutes
