# Lab: Linear Regression (using OCI Data Science service)

## Introduction

This lab will guide you through a practical example of how to train and apply a regression model. You have access to a dataset with house sale data. The dataset includes the Sale Price and many attributes that describe some aspect of the house, including size, area, features, et cetera. You will use this dataset to build a regression model that can be used to estimate what a house with certain characteristics might sell for.

There are many uses of regression in business. Some well spread examples are around forecasting and optimization. For example, predicting future demand for products, estimating the optimal price for a product and fine-tuning manufacturing and delivery processes. In other words, the principles that you learn with this exercise are applicable to those business scenarios as well.

This video covers additional theory that you require to be able to do the exercise.

Estimated lab time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:
* Become familiar with Data Exploration, Data Preparation, Model training and Evaluation techniques.
* Become familiar with Python and its popular ML libraries, in particular Scikit Learn.
* Become familiar with the OCI Data Science service.

### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account (see prerequisites in workshop menu)
* You've completed the previous lab. You have successfully provisioned a notebook.

## Task 1: Install a Conda package

 A Conda package is a collection of libraries, programs, components and metadata. It defines a reproducible set of libraries that are used in the data science environment.

1. Click on "Environment Explorer"

    ![Upload Dataset](images/choose-conda.png)

2. Search for a suitable Conda environment that suits the type of development that we're going to do.

   - Search for the "TensorFlow 2.7 for CPU on Python 3.7" Conda environment. At the time of writing this lab, it was at the top of the list, you may have to use the search field to find it and select "show depreceated" at top right of page.
   - Open the details by clicking on the down arrow at the right.
   - Copy the installation command to the clipboard by clicking on the Copy button.

    ![Upload Dataset](images/get-install-cmd.png)

3. Open a terminal window by clicking on **File**, **New** and then **Terminal**.

    ![Upload Dataset](images/open-terminal.png)

4. Paste the command from the clipboard.

   `odsc conda install -s tensorflow27_p37_cpu_v1`

5. You will receive a prompt related to what version number you want. Press `Enter` to select the default.

6. Wait for the conda package to be installed.

    ![Image](images/result-conda-install.png)

   This will take about 5 minutes.

## Task 2: Prepare the House Sales Data for analysis

The following assumes that you are logged into the Data Science service that you created in the previous lab.

1. Download [The training dataset](https://objectstorage.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/p/ppAp1f2IRW2AP7H32-6NqyxPFV3scK5SAdATDQl1qAn86F5uGUd1W7d5AJJdB8mz/n/fruktknlrefu/b/workshop-intro-to-ds/o/housesales.csv) (the dataset is public). Depending on the browser you might have to use Left/Right click to do this. **Make sure the extension of the saved file is .csv, in some cases the browser may try to save it as .xls instead**.

2. Review the dataset (e.g. use a text editor).

   The column names are explained [here](files/data-description.txt). This document also explains the possible list-of-values for categorical attributes.

3. Upload the dataset by dragging it to the left panel

   ![Upload Dataset](images/uploaddataset.png)

## Task 3: Start the Python notebook

1. Create a Notebook

    If you don't have a launcher open yet, do so by going to File -> New Launcher.

    It is **important** to select the Python environment with the right Conda environment that we just installed. Look for the notebook that uses Conda **"TensorFlow 2.7 for CPU on Python 3.7"** and choose "Create Notebook".

    ![Start Python notebook](images/start-notebook.png).

## Task 4: Data Exploration

The goals of Data Exploration are to identify what data you have and what is usable, identify issues such as missing values and outliers, and to form ideas of new features that could be calculated (Feature Engineering). Later on we'll use the knowledge that we gain during Data Exploration to decide which data transformations to perform.

1. Copy the code for loading the required Python libraries

    - `Pandas` is a library that's used for working with data, e.g. displaying it and doing data transformations.
    - `Numpy` is a library to work with arrays and for calculations.
    - `Sklearn` is the standard Python library for machine learning. It provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.
    - `Seaborn` is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.

    Press the copy button on the fragment below.

     ```python
     <copy>
     import pandas as pd
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plot
     import seaborn as sns
     import numpy as np
     from scipy.stats import norm
     from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     from sklearn import linear_model
     from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
     from scipy import stats
     import warnings
     warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
     %matplotlib inline
     </copy>
     ```

2. Paste the code into the Notebook and run it

   ![Run Script](images/runscript.png)

   Follow the copy-paste approach every time you see a piece of code like this.

   Have a look at the bottom left of the window.
   When a command is still running it will show "Busy". When it has finished, you will see "Idle".

   **Always make sure that the last command has finished running (status=Idle) before running another cell.**

   If all is well, in this case you should not see any error message. The cursor simply moves to the next cell.

   ![Run Script](images/noresult.png)

3. Load the training data

   We'll split this into train and test later. All these type of data operations are handled by the Pandas library (named `"pd"` here)

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata = pd.read_csv('./housesales.csv')
    </copy>
    ```

    This step does not output anything.

4. Check how much data we have

   Is the dataset large enough to train a model?

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata.shape
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step1.png)

    This shows that there are 1460 rows, which at first sight looks like a good enough to train an initial model. The data is not extensive enough for production use but would help establish a good baseline. We also see that there are 80 input features that we can potentially use to predict our target variable.

5. Review the target attribute: `SalePrice`

    Before we look at the input features, let's have a close look at our Target attribute: `SalePrice`.

    First, let's display some values. The `[:10]` selects only the first 10 rows.

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata['SalePrice'][:10]
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step2.png)

6. Let's check if there are any empty values

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata['SalePrice'].isnull().sum()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step3.png)

7. Let's check the price range:

    ```python
    <copy>
    minPrice = alldata['SalePrice'].min()
    maxPrice = alldata['SalePrice'].max()

    print('Min Sales Price (%d) - Max Sales Price (%d)' % (minPrice,maxPrice))
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step4.png)

    This tells us that *SalePrice* is an integer and has numbers in the range that we would expect from house prices. There are no empty values. We could see however that the price range is very wide from a 34900 up to 755000. This would require to scale the price to allow the algorithm to learn better.

8. Which columns will we select as input features for our model?

   Let's start by listing all the columns.

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata.columns
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step5.png)

    As we can see there are too many, maybe more useful will be to separate them and see only the numerical and the categorical ones.

9. Separate the columns into numerical and categorical

    Let's get a list of all numeric features first.

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns.tolist()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step6.png)

10. Show a sample of numerical columns

   Now that we see the numeric columns we could also show a sample to get some impression about the data.

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step7.png)

11. Show a list of categorical columns

   We could do the same for all categorical variables, notice this time we use the property `exclude` in the `select_dtypes` function...

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata.select_dtypes(exclude=np.number).columns.tolist()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step8.png)

12. Show a sample of categorical variables

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata.select_dtypes(exclude=[np.number])
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step9.png)

13. What can we conclude about the columns?

    There are many input features that we could potentially use. Some of these columns are self explanatory, others not so much. To understand what each column means, have a look at [data_description.txt](./files/data-description.txt) for background.

14. Which columns would we select intuitively?

    To start with, let's first take an intuitive approach. Ask yourself:

   "Which of these columns is likely of value to predict Sale Price?"
   "Which factors of a house would I look at yourself when making a buying decision?"
   "Is enough information available in these columns, are there any empty values?"

   Imagine that we've decide that we believe the following features are relevant: `GrLivArea` size of living area, `TotalBsmtSF` size of basement, `OverallQual` overall quality category, `YearBuilt` year house was built `MSZoning` A=Agriculture, C=Commercial, RH=Residential High Density, etc.

15. Are the columns we intuitively selected also actually correlated with the Sale Price?

   Let's test our theories that these input features are correlated with Sale Price. We'll start with the numerical variables first: `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `OverallQual` and `YearBuilt`.
   Because all of these are numerical continuous attributes, we can use scatter plots here.

    ```python
    <copy>
    plot.scatter(alldata.GrLivArea, alldata.SalePrice)
    plot.xlabel("GrLivArea")
    plot.ylabel("SalePrice")
    plot.show()
    plot.scatter(alldata.TotalBsmtSF, alldata.SalePrice)
    plot.xlabel("TotalBsmtSF")
    plot.ylabel("SalePrice")
    plot.show()
    plot.scatter(alldata.OverallQual, alldata.SalePrice)
    plot.xlabel("OverallQual")
    plot.ylabel("SalePrice")
    plot.show()
    plot.scatter(alldata.YearBuilt, alldata.SalePrice)
    plot.xlabel("YearBuilt")
    plot.ylabel("SalePrice")
    plot.show()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step10.png)

    We can draw these conclusions:
    - `GrLivArea`: There is a linear correlation with `SalePrice`; We can draw a straight line from the bottom-left to the top-right.
    - `TotalBsmtSF`: There appears to be an relationship between `TotalBsmtSF` and `SalePrice` too, but not that obvious. It seems a higher basement sizes lead to higher prices but we could notice that there are some outliers.
    - `OveralQual`: As expected, there is a higher sales price when overall quality perception is higher. But that is not necessary for the entire price range. Probably the quality of the house is not enough and the price would depend on the location or the zoning as well.
    - `YearBuilt`: This relationship is a little less obvious, but there's a trend for higher prices for more recent construction.

    These attributes appear to be of predictive value and we definitely want to keep them in our training set!

    On another note, we see several **outliers**. In particular, the attribute `GrLivArea` shows that there are some houses with exceptionally large living areas given their price. We could notice this also for the `TotalBsmtSF`. Generally it is recommended to build the initial model with all the available values first and then start removing outliers to see if this would improve the prediction and make the model generalize better.

16. Is the categorical attribute `MSZoning` also correlated with `SalePrice`?

   This attribute contains the type of property (`A=Agriculture`, `C=Commercial`, `RH=Residential High Density`, et cetera). Correlation between a categorical and a continuous attribute (SalePrice) can be visualized as a boxplot.

    ```python
    <copy>
    var = 'MSZoning'
    data = pd.concat([alldata['SalePrice'], alldata[var]], axis=1)
    f, ax = plot.subplots(figsize=(10, 7))
    fig = sns.boxplot(x=var, y="SalePrice", data=data)
    fig.axis(ymin=0, ymax=800000)
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step11.png)

   What can we conclude from this? The boxplots for the various types of properties look very different. From the plot we could see that the residential areas seems to be more expensive than commercial, but the price range is high. So, again, MSZoning appears to contain important
   information to predict the price.

17. What is the relationship between Neighborhood and SalePrice?

   Let's explore also the relationship of the Neighborhood to the price. We can plot the data using the same technique.

    ```python
    <copy>
    var = 'Neighborhood'
    data = pd.concat([alldata['SalePrice'], alldata[var]], axis=1)
    f, ax = plot.subplots(figsize=(30, 10))
    fig = sns.boxplot(x=var, y="SalePrice", data=data)
    fig.axis(ymin=0, ymax=800000)
    </copy>
    ```

   Result:

   ![Run Script](images/step12.png)

   The plot is not necessary conclusive, but it appears that as expected some areas are more expensive than others. As such we should keep this columns and use it in the model. Notice that some areas shown very large range of prices and spikes like **NridgHt** or **StoneBr** or very large outliers like in **NoRidge** with prices more than double as the usual range for that neighborhood. After the initial model build you could try to remove these outliers and test if the model would have better performance.

18. A different approach: Systematically checking for correlation between input features and our target

   It becomes clear that manually investigating all of the attributes this way is very time consuming. Therefore, let's take a more systematic approach. Ideally, we would like to see the correlation between all input attributes and the target `SalePrice`.

    ```python
    <copy>
    corr = alldata.corr(method='spearman')
    corr.sort_values(["SalePrice"], ascending = False, inplace = True)
    corr.SalePrice
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step13.png)

   The conclusion is that our intuition of thinking that `TotalBsmtSF`, `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea` and `YearBuilt` are of importance, was correct. However, there are other features listed as high correlation, such as `GarageCars`, `GarageArea` and `Fullbath`.

   Here's a list  of the features that are most correlated with our target:
    - `OverallQual`: Rates the overall material and finish of the house (1 = Very Poor, 10 = Very Excellent)
    - `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
    - `GarageCars`: Size of garage in car capacity
    - `GarageArea`: Size of garage in square feet
    - `TotalBsmtSF`: Total square feet of basement area
    - `1stFlrSF`: First Floor square feet
    - `FullBath`: Full bathrooms above grade
    - `TotRmsAbvGrd`: Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms)
    - `YearBuilt`: Original construction date

19. Is there data missing from some of the columns?

   Many machine learning models are unable to handle missing data. We have to find out how much data is missing.

   At the moment of replacing missing data, we should first find out whether that would cause some kind of distortion in the data and have a negative effect on model quality.

   Therefore, we have to see if the missing data follows certain patterns.

   Check how many Empty values each column has, and compute the percentage of the total number of rows.

    ```python
    <copy>
    total = alldata.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
    percent = (alldata.isnull().sum()/alldata.isnull().count()).sort_values(ascending=False)
    missing_data = pd.concat([total, percent], axis=1, keys=['Total', 'Percent'])
    missing_data.head(20)
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step14.png)

    There are a lot of attributes with missing values. This is especially the case for attributes `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence` and `FireplaceQu`.

20. Let's investigate the attributes with most missing values in detail

   Have a look at the [data description](files/data-description.txt) for these columsn in particular. The description of the attribute `PoolQC` (pool quality) is as follows:

    - `Ex - Excellent`
    - `Gd - Good`
    - `TA - Average/Typical`
    - `Fa - Fair`
    - `NA - No Pool`

   It seems sensible to assume that most houses don't have pools and therefore missing values simply mean `"No Pool"`. Therefore we make a note to replace those missing values with `"NA"`.
   Similarly, we make a note to replace the missing values for `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence` and `FireplaceQu` with `"NA"`.

   The next attribute with many hidden values is `LotFrontage`, which means `"Linear feet of street connected to property"`. This is a continuous measure, and we choose that we will replace missing values by with the mean of the existing values. We'll see more of this in the Data Preparation stage.

21. Check the distribution of the Target variable

    It's important that the target variable follows Normal Probability distribution. If it does not, this will negatively impact the model's performance. We can check for this using a histogram, and including a normal probability plot. The Seaborn library does this for us.

    ```python
    <copy>
    sns.distplot(alldata['SalePrice'], fit=norm);
    fig = plot.figure()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step15.png)

    We can conclude from this that the values of the Target variable currently deviate from the Normal Distribution. You see that it is left skewed. The regression algorithms that we will use later on has problems with such a distribution. This is another problem that we will have to address during data preparation phase.

## Task 5: Data Preparation

   During Data Exploration, we have realized that several changes must be made to the dataset. Data Preparation is a logical result of Data Exploration; we will now take action based on the insights that we gained earlier.

1. Update missing values

   In the previous topic (identifying Missing Values) we made the decision that:

   We want to replace the missing values of `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence` and `FireplaceQu` with `"NA"`.
   We will replace missing values of `LotFrontage` with the mean of the existing values. Let's do this:

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata = alldata.fillna({"PoolQC": "NA"})
    alldata = alldata.fillna({"MiscFeature": "NA"})
    alldata = alldata.fillna({"Alley": "NA"})
    alldata = alldata.fillna({"Fence": "NA"})
    alldata = alldata.fillna({"FireplaceQu": "NA"})
    meanlot = alldata['LotFrontage'].mean()
    alldata = alldata.fillna({"LotFrontage": meanlot})
    alldata = alldata.dropna()
    </copy>
    ```

    This step does not output anything.

2. Handling Outliers

   Do you remember that the scatter chart for `GrLivArea` showed several outliers (scroll back to see this if necessary)? Let's remove these two outliers, by identifying the houses with the highest `GrLivArea`.

   Show the IDs of the houses with the highest GrLivArea.

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata.sort_values(by = 'GrLivArea', ascending = False)[:2]
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step16.png)

3. Remove the Outliers

    We are also plotting the chart again to check that the outliers have disappeared.

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata = alldata.drop(alldata[alldata['Id'] == 1299].index)
    alldata = alldata.drop(alldata[alldata['Id'] == 524].index)
    plot.scatter(alldata.GrLivArea, alldata.SalePrice)
    plot.xlabel("GrLivArea")
    plot.ylabel("SalePrice")
    plot.show()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step17.png)

    You notice that those outliers have disappeared.

4. Handling the skewed distribution of the Target variable

   Do you remember that the histogram of `SalePrice` showed a positive skew? We can solve this problem by converting the target variable. We use a **log** transformation to make the variable fit normal distribution. Let's make the log transformation and show the histogram again to check the result.

    ```python
    <copy>
    y = np.log(alldata['SalePrice'])
    sns.distplot(y, fit=norm)
    fig = plot.figure()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step18.png)

    You will notice that the sales price now follows a normal distribution. We will use the newly created `y` variable later to fit our model.

5. Removing irrelevant features

   In any case we will remove the ID column, which does not carry any predictive value. We will also remove the attributes that showed very low correlation with `SalePrice` during Data Exploration. Note that this is a fairly brute approach, but it is again sufficient for our exercise. After the first model build, you could start adding back some of the features and observe if the model will generalize better.

    ```python
    <copy>
    alldata.drop("Id", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("BsmtFullBath", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("BsmtUnfSF", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("ScreenPorch", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("MoSold", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("3SsnPorch", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("PoolArea", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("MSSubClass", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("YrSold", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("BsmtFinSF2", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("MiscVal", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("LowQualFinSF", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("OverallCond", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("KitchenAbvGr", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    alldata.drop("EnclosedPorch", axis = 1, inplace = True)
    </copy>
    ```

    This step does not output anything.

6. Separating Target and Input Features

    Scikit Learn expects that we deliver the data for training in two parts:

    - A dataset with a single column, the target, in this case `SalePrice`. We did this already earlier by taking the **log** of the `SalePrice` and storing it in `"y"` variable.
    - A dataset with all the input columns, in this case all columns apart from `SalePrice`. We will place this in variable `"X"`.

    Get all the data with the exception of the `SalePrice` and place it in variable X:

    ```python
    <copy>
    X = alldata.drop(['SalePrice'], axis=1)
    </copy>
    ```

    This step does not output anything.

7. Convert categorical values to numbers

   Most ML algorithms can only work with numbers. Therefore we should convert categories to numbers first.

   For all attributes we will assume that they are Nominal (as opposed to Ordinal), meaning that there's no order/sequence in the values that it can take. The go-to method to encode Nominal categorical values is Onehot Encoding. This will convert each separate value of a category into its own column that can take a value of 1 or 0. The Pandas `get_dummies` function does OneHot encoding.

   You will see that after this the `SaleType` column has been converted into `SaleType_ConLw`, `SaleType_New`, et cetera. The same transformation has taken place on all categorical variables. The dataset now only has numerical values.

    ```python
    <copy>
    X = pd.get_dummies(X)
    X.head()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step19.png)

## Task 6: Building the model

   We will build a simple Linear Regression model. We will use the Scikit-Learn library for this.

1. Split Train and Test data so we can validate the model later

   After building the model, we will want to test its performance against new data. It's important that this data has not been seen before during the model training. To achieve this we have to reserve part of our dataset for testing, which will be removed from the training phase.

   We'll reserve 20% of the total dataset for testing. The random_state variable is for initializng the randomizer. By hardcoding it here we make sure that we select the same records everytime that we run the script.

    After this we will have 4 variables:
    - `X_train`: The input features of the training dataset.
    - `X_test`: The input features of the test dataset.
    - `y_train`: The target of the training dataset.
    - `y_train`: The target of the test dataset.

    ```python
    <copy>
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=63, test_size=.20)
    </copy>
    ```

    This step does not output anything.

2. Build the model

   Now we're ready to build the model (on the training data only). Building the model is also called "fitting".

    ```python
    <copy>
    lr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
    model = lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
    </copy>
    ```

    If all is well, you should not see any output, meaning that there are no errors.

    That's it! After all our hard word of data exploration and preparation, training the model was relatively simple!

## Task 7: Verifying the performance of the model

How accurate is our model? We will use the Test dataset for this.

1. First apply the predictions on the Test dataset

    ```python
    <copy>
    y_predicted = model.predict(X_test)
    </copy>
    ```

    This step does not output anything.

2. Look at the prediction of one particular house

    From the given test set we get the data of one house and check the predicted value.

    ```python
    <copy>
    y_predicted[0]
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step20.png)

3. Convert the value back to an actual house price

    You would notice that the price above is strange, it shows a number that doesn't seem to be a normal house Sales Price. If you remember we scaled the SalePrice by using np.log(SalePrice) to get the prices in smaller range and help the algorithm generalize and learn better. To get the real price now we need to revert back this scale. To do so we have to use np.exp.

    ```python
    <copy>
    np.exp(y_predicted[0])
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step21.png)

    This appears to be an actual house price.

4. An intuitive, visual approach to verification

   To verify the quality of the predictions, let's first use an intuitive visual approach, which works well for linear regression models. For this we will display in one plot:

    - a. The actual `SalePrice` (according to the original data in the Test dataset)
    - b. The predicted `SalePrice` (the value according to our model)

    We're plotting this as a scatter.

    ```python
    <copy>
    plot.scatter(y_predicted, y_test)
    plot.xlabel('Predicted Sale Price')
    plot.ylabel('Actual Sale Price')
    plot.title('Comparing Predicted and Actual Sale Prices')
    plot.plot(range(11, 15), range(11, 15), color="red")
    plot.show()
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step22.png)

    In ideal circumstances we'd like to see the predictions falling on the line of actual values. This would mean that Predicted and Actual Sale Prices are the same. In our case, although the points are not oriented in a perfectly straight line, the model appears to be fairly accurate.

5. A measurable approach to verification

    How can we express the accuracy of the model in a more mathematical way? For that we use a quality metric, in this case we could use [RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation).

    `RMSE` measures the distance between the predictions and the actual values. A lower value for RMSE means a higher accuracy. Scikit-Learn has a function to calculate RMSE.

    ```python
    <copy>
    print('RMSE: ', mean_squared_error(y_test, y_predicted))
    </copy>
    ```

    Result:

    ![Run Script](images/step23.png)

    RMSE by itself is not easy to interpret, but it can be used to compare different versions of a model, to see whether a change you've made has resulted in an improvement. So we can use it later on when we change the model configuration and check whether the changes improved/worsened the accuracy.

    Congratulations on building your first model!
