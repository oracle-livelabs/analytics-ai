## About this Workshop

If you're a technical professional and you would like to broaden your skillset with Data Science and Machine Learning, then this is the workshop for you!

Without a doubt you've heard about the potential of this new field. There are many proven applications throughout industries and business functions, and many new cases are still waiting to be discovered. For the professional this means that there's an enormous opportunity to ride this wave of innovation.

In this workshop we will start with the necessary theory on Data Science and Machine Learning. Therefore, no previous knowledge is required. After the theory we'll move to a product overview and you will get the chance to practice with various products in Oracle Cloud, for example OCI Data Science, OCI Autonomous Data Warehouse, and OCI Object Storage.

The target audience are people without previous Data Science experience that would like to get started with this new field, for example:
- Application developers that would like to add ML to their applications or business flows.
- Other (IT) professionals with technical affinity.

Estimated workshop time: 300 minutes (this includes all the labs in this workshop)
