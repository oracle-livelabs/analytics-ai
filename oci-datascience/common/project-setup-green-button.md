# Data Science Project Setup

## Introduction

Projects are used to collect related data science resources and artifact, such that it enables you to organize your work. They contain a collection of notebook sessions and models.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 5 minutes

### Objective
In this lab, you:
* Use the Console to create a Data Science Project.

### Prerequisites

* A tenancy that is configured to work with the Data Science service.
* An account that has permission to create a Data Science project.

## Task 1: Creating a Project

You create a Data Science project to organize your notebook sessions and models within your project.

1. At the top of this page in the **Workshop Details** section, note the name of the compartment. It generally has the format ``LL####-COMPARTMENT`` where ``####`` is a number.
1. [Login to the OCI Console](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html).
1. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Analytics & AI**, and select **Data Science**. 
	![Navigation to Data Science](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/analytics-ml-datascience.png " ")
1. Select the compartment, generally, you will need to expand (click the + symbol) the ``root`` and ``Livelabs`` sections. Then select the compartment name that you noted earlier.

1. Click **Create Project**.

1. (Optional, but recommended) Enter a unique name (255 character limit) for the project. If you do not provide a name, a name is automatically generated for you.
1. (Optional, but recommended) Enter a description (400 character limit) for the project. If you do not add a description, it remains empty.
1. (Optional) Add tags to easily locate and track the project by selecting a tag namespace, then entering the key and value. To add more than one tag, click **+Additional Tags**. [Tagging](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm) describes the various tags that you can use organize and find projects including [cost-tracking tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Tasks/usingcosttrackingtags.htm).
1. (Optional) To view the details for your project immediately after creation, select **Display project details after creation**.

1. Click **Create**.

This creates the project and opens the project page.

You can **proceed to the next lab**.
