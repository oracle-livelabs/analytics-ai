# Introduction

##About this Workshop

This workshop introduces you to **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Integration** and will give you a full tour of the service in a hands-on manner.

Administrators, data engineers, ETL developers and operators are among the different types of data professionals who can use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Integration and would benefit from this workshop. We will create a workspace in OCI Data Integration, connect to data assets, use Data Flows along with Integration tasks, create a Data Loader task and Orchestrate and finally Schedule the Tasks.

You will transform and load data into Autonomous Data Warehouse, you will also orchestrate plus schedule jobs in a data pipeline and monitor the job.

Estimated Time: 75 Minutes

##What is OCI Data Integration?

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Integration is a fully managed, multi-tenant, serverless, native cloud service that helps you with common extract, load, and transform (ETL) tasks such as ingesting data from different sources, cleansing, transforming, and reshaping that data, and then efficiently loading it to target data sources on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 
Data engineers will be able to easily automate ETL data flows, prepare datasets quickly for Data Science projects, and stand up new data lake Services from cloud context and hybrid connectivity.

##Objectives

- Get a high level overview on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the architecture for Data Integration
- Learn to use OCI Data Integration
- Create a bulk Data Loader task leveraging existing data assets to load into ADW from OCI Object Storage.
- Create a Pipeline, Pipeline task and publish tasks into an Application
- Run the Data Loader task, Schedule and run the Pipeline task
