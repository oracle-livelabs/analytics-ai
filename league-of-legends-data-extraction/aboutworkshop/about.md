# About This Workshop

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

## Introduction

League of Legends is one of the most played videogames in the entire world. In this workshop, we'll leverage the power of AI with League of Legends in a unique and innovative way. We'll dive deep into extractable data (accessible through the game's API), how to structure this data, and how to use it to train our own Machine Learning model to generate real-time predictions about any match.

Are you interested in learning machine learning (ML)? How about doing this in the context of the exciting world of gaming?! Get your ML skills bootstrapped here!

Here's a short 3-minute introductory video into League of Legends:

## About Product/Technology

OCI Data Science is a fully managed and serverless platform for data science teams to build, train, and manage machine learning models using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

The Data Science Service:

- Provides data scientists with a collaborative, project-driven workspace.
- Enables self-service, serverless access to infrastructure for data science workloads.
- Helps data scientists concentrate on methodology and domain expertise to deliver models to production.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following steps:

&check; Data Collection - Download datasets

&check; Data Preparation - Preparing datasets

&check; Data Load - Searching for patterns in datasets

&check; Implement ML Models - Develop, different ML models, evaluate best model and tune

&check; Data Integration - Connecting to real-time data sources


## OCI Elements

This solution is designed to work with several OCI services, allowing you to quickly be up-and-running. You can read more about the services used in the lab here:

- [OCI Data Science](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/data-science/)
- [OCI Cloud Shell](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellintro.htm)
- [OCI Compute](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/)
- [OCI Autonomous JSON Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/autonomous-json-database/)

## Data Sets

We'll access datasets uploaded to OCI Object Storage. You don't need to download any datasets by yourself, everything will be **automated**.

They are optionally also uploaded to [this Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/jasperan/league-of-legends-1v1-matchups-results). This repository contains several files, make sure you check all available datasets if you're interested and give a thumbs up if you find them useful.
