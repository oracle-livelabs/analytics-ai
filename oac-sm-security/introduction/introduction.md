# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Data-level security defines what a user in an analytics application can access inside a report. When run by two different users, the same report can bring up different data. The structure of the view is the same for all users, unless a user does not have access to the subject area, in which case the report displays an error. Ensuring that only authorized people can access specific data is important to prevent sensitive information from being queried or run.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes
