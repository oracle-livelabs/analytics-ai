# Essbase Drill Through Feature


## Introduction

In this lab, you are using Essbase drill-through functionality to display additional detailed data that is retrieved from the external data sources. When you create an Essbase cube, you do not use all the data from an external data source. You choose and summarize the data in the cube for Essbase users to analyze. The additional detailed data is not available in the Essbase cube.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 60 minutes

### Objectives

* Connecting and verifyng data in Oracle Database.
* Create a connection from Essbase 21c to Oracle Database.
* Build dimension using data in database.
* Load data from Database to Essbase cube.
* View / analyze data from database in Smart View.
* Drill through to data in database from Smart View.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup
    - Lab: Initialize Environment  


## Task 1: Create the cube
We are creating a variation of the Sample/Basic cube where Market dim has Region in the leaf level and it has no State. We are then loading data from a relational table. The relational table contains Sales data that contains breakdown of Region Sales figures by States. All the Sales numbers for different states in a Region gets added to that Region. The summaries in Essbase enable users to compare Sales figures across Regions.

1. Log in to Essbase Web user interface.

2. Download the worksheet Sample\_Basic\_DT.xlsx.  

   This file is part of Workshop artifacts. Steps to download the artifacts are mentioned in **Lab: Initialize Environment-> step2**.

3. On the Home page, click **Import**.

   Click **File Browser**, and browse to select Sample\_Basic\_DT.xlsx excelsheet.

   Change application name Sample to **SampleDT**.
   
   ![Import File](./images/imageDT_01.png " ")

4. Go to home. Expand application SampleDT<StudentID>, cube Basic, select Actions and click **Outline**. Click on the Market dimension and check that regions are at leaf level.
   
   ![Outline](./images/imageDT_02.png " ")


5.  Close the outline browser tab.

6.	Open the query worksheet QueryDT.Sample within Sample\_Basic\_DT.xlsx.   
   Login to Smart View. Select the application SampleDT, click **Connect** and click **Set active connection**.

7.  Go to Smart View Ribbon, click **Options –> Cell Styles –> Essbase –> Data Cells** and pick colors for  Drill-through (blue), Read-Only (pink), Writable (green) and Linked Objects (yellow).

   For example, select **Drill-through**,  double click on it, and then double-click **Background** to pick the required color.

   Click **OK**.

8. Refresh the sheet in Smart View. Notice data cells E2 to E11 representing Sales figures for different Regions are all color coded green.
   
   ![Sales Figure for different regions](./images/imageDT_04.png " ")


## Task 2: Check the data in relational table (optional)

   **Note**: The data is already loaded in the database.  

1. Open SQL Developer. Create a connection to your Oracle Database.

   Enter the details: Connection Name, Username, Password, Hostname(IP), Port, Service name.

   ![SQL Developer Details](./images/imageDT_05.png " ")

   Password for Esscs Schema: **Admin123**.

2. Query the data in the relational table:
   Right-click on Connection name -> Open SQL Worksheet. Type the query and check the result:   
    ```
    <copy>        
          select product, market, statename, scenario, year, sales from SALES_BREAKDOWN_SB order by product, market, scenario, year, sales;
	</copy>
    ````
   ![SQL query worksheet](./images/imageDT_06.png " ")

   Notice for example: For the month April, under the Central region, there are 6 Sales figures, one each for the 6 States under the Central region. These 6 Sales numbers are getting accumulated into the Sales for Central region for the month of April.

3. Check the database table **SALES\_BREAKDOWN\_SB**. Type the query:

    ```
    <copy>        
          Select * from SALES_BREAKDOWN_SB
	</copy>
    ````
   ![SQL query result](./images/imageDT_07.png " ")

   ![Load Data](./images/imageDT_25.png " ")

8. Click **Refresh** to update the status. Once the job is completed, click **Job Details** from the right side dropdown to check Job execution status.
   
   ![Job Details - Load Data](./images/imageDT_26.png " ")


## Task 8: Execute Drill-through
1.	Go back to Smart View. Refresh the query sheet. Observe the Sales figure for the Central region.
   
   ![Smartview query sheet](./images/imageDT_27.png " ")

2.	The sales for the month of April in Central region is 1207.

    To see the detailed breakdown of Sales by States in Central region, double click on cell E5 1207.   

    Execute the drill-through report defined in cell E5 by clicking Drill-through in the Essbase ribbon.

    A new sheet is displayed with the results of the drill-through report execution which contains the detailed breakdown.

    Note:  
    1) There are 6 states in Central region with Sales for April. This matches the Sales query results from the relational table. Check Column C Statename showing the breakdown.  

    2) Enter a formula in cell F8 to sum the Sales numbers for the States: =SUM(F2:F7). The sum is 1207 which is the same value as the summarized Sales for region Central in the Essbase cube.

    3) The column names A1 to F1 for the drill-through table matches the Alias you specified in the drill-through datasource definition.
