# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Coaching staffs in sports and business leaders around the world rely on Oracle Analytics Cloud tools to power strategic decisions. In this lab you will be optimizing an NBA team’s potential game score by analyzing the possibility of recovering 2 and 3 point opportunities based on the in-game shooting percentages. In this ‘What If’ scenario you will select a number of possible recovered points to determine if there is an opportunity to change the outcome of a game based on coaching strategy.  Does your lineup strategy change if you choose to recover more 2-point opportunities? What happens if you tell your players to recover more 3-point chances? 

Not only does "what if" analysis provide an opportunity to test scenarios using real world data, but it also affords users the chance to predict and mitigate potentially unforeseen risks. Using this technique to develop strategies proves to be invaluable in time-critical decision making such as NBA coaching and disaster preparedness.
