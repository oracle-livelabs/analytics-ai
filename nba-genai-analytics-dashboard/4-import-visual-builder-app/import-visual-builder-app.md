5. Enter the domain of the visual builder app url in the empty field and clicked **Embedded**. 

>>**Note:** The URL can include *wildcard* syntax, which means if you want to approve all apps on OCI, you can simply put **\*oraclecloud.com**, however, since we only need the visual builder app, we will put the url link for the instance. Use only the root URL for the Visual Builder without the **https://** and terminating **/**.

>>**Note:** The host is the URL of the analytics instance from step 6. The project path is the object id from the step 8.

>>**Note:** Make sure Compatability Mode is **no**. The iframe in the preview of the webpage will automatically update with the Analytics workbook. If it does not, the you will need to repeat steps the steps from the previous lab to ensure you have it correctly mapped.
