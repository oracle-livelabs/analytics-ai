# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop walks you through the creation of a medallion architecture using the AI Data Platform (AIDP) Workbench and 26ai database. Along the way you will learn the fundamentals of working with the AIDP Workbench including concepts like the master catalog, workspaces, compute clusters, and workflows. You will also learn how to link your data to Oracle Analytics Cloud for data visualization, and how to bring data from Fusion AI Data Platform to your AIDP Workbench.

A medallion architecture is a data engineering design that organizes data into 3 tiers of quality being bronze, silver, and gold. The bronze tier holds unprocessed and mostly raw data, the silver holds cleaned and organized data, while the gold tier holds process, transformed, clean data that is ready for its final use. This final use could be analytics, ingestion into an application, or for an AI use case. This approach provides clear data lineage and allows for easy augmentation of the data processing pipeline.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours 40 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Provision an AI Data Platform Workbench instance.
* Load data into and access external data from the master catalog.
* Create a medallion architecture using data from the master catalog in the AIDP Workbench notebook interface.
* Create and schedule jobs from the Workflows tab.
* Connect the AIDP Workbench to Oracle Analytics Cloud for data visualization.
* Connect Fusion AI Data Platform to your AI Data Platform for data sharing.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

This lab assumes you have:
* Intermediate knowedge of OCI preferred
* Must have your own Fusion AI Data Platform instance for the optional 5th lab.
