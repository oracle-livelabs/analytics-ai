# Introduction

## About this Workshop 

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to Oracle Data Integrator Web Edition. The workshop is designed to be used alongside your own cloud account (paid or Bring-Your-Own-License) or you can register and claim free trial credits which provides up to 3,300 hours of cloud time, and 2 TB of storage, which is more than enough time and storage space to run this workshop.

This workshop goes over the deployment process for ODI Web Edition and then gives you introductory skills for Data Transforms tool. Data Transforms is powered by Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) which is market leading data integration tool for more than a decade. Data Transforms tool hides the complexity of ODI and makes the data integration capability available for departmental users. This workshop uses only Autonomous Database as source and target for simplicity but the same tool can be used to extract data from hybrid data sources (including Fusion and Salesforce), load into various target destinations and transform as needed for any data integration project.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours and 30 minutes
